Friendly reminder not to work too hard. You'll just get fired,"The year just started and there are already over 50K layoffs. The latest one is UPS, including some data professionals at corporate. These are people who worked hard, built a career with the company over extremely long period of time, stayed loyal, 3% merit increases, worked extra hours because they believed that they were contributing to a better future for the company and themselves.... And they were laid off without a second thought for cost saving. Yeah, Because that makes so much sense, right? Record-breaking profits every year is an unattainable goal, and it's stupid that here in the USA, we are one of the only countries that keeps pushing for this while other countries are leaving us in the dust with their quality of life....


So just remember. If you're thinking about doing some overtime for free, or going above and beyond just for a pat on the back, don't do it. You only have so many years on Earth.

I investigated the Underground Economy of Glassdoor Reviews,"Online company reviews are high stakes.

Top reviews on sites like Glassdoor and Google can get thousands of impressions each month and are major drivers of brand perception.

Employers know this. And when I come across multiple 5 star reviews left with no cons, or a Pulitzer worthy essay from a former intern, I become suspicious.

These reviews start to resemble 30 under 30 lists: so artificially constructed that you begin to question their credibility in the first place.

The scrutiny around company reviews is well documented; some companies file lawsuits worth over a million dollars to reveal anonymous reviewers that complain about their jobs.

Whilst it's the flashy lawsuits that make the headlines, there also exists an underground economy of company reviews operating quietly every single day.

In this underground economy, some companies pay over $150 to freelancers to try and get a negative review removed. If they want “better” results, they go to the plethora of Online Reputation Management services (ORMs) in the United States that can charge retainers worth thousands of dollars.

The supply of positive reviews exists too. My research led me to find companies, including a prominent Y-Combinator backed startup, that solicit fake positive reviews from online freelancers to improve their rating.

Many of these mercenary fake reviewers, often based in South East Asia, make a full time living doing this, netting over $2,000 per month.

Some of these run such sophisticated operations that they’ve even created their own pricing tiers (e.g $35 per original review, $20 to post an already created review from an email address), a la SaaS offering.

Others operate on a contingency fee agreement model, where they only get paid if they’re able to take a negative review down.

The underground economy of company reviews is well and truly alive. And today we’re going to find out how it operates.

**Adding reviews**

The barriers to entry for adding fake reviews are much lower than for getting reviews removed, so that’s where we’ll start.

To write an employer review, all you really need is the ability to create an email address. For most sites, you don’t need any proof of employment (say like a company specific email address).

I went on a gig marketplace site and posted a pretty vague post related to wanting to find out more on how to improve a company’s online presence.

Within minutes of posting a gig, my inbox was flooded with proposals:

https://preview.redd.it/esx3904qa20b1.png?width=3064&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ff3a2f8528fee99aabb830f27ea71a7569ebb2e

After a bit of chatting, I narrowed the scope of their services and summarized their rates into the table below:

|Channel|Cost|Timeline|Model|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Freelancer #1|$10 per review|Monthly|Unlimited|
|Freelancer #2|$35 per original review, $20 per already created review|Monthly|Unlimited|
|Freelancer #3|$25 per review|Monthly|Unlimited|
|Freelancer #4|$25 per review|Monthly|10 reviews|
|Freelancer #5|$20 per review|Monthly|Unlimited|
|Online Reputation Management Agency|$300 subscription|Monthly|8 reviews|

Let’s dive a bit deeper into the services that Freelancer #5 offered.

Freelancer #5 explained to me he had been writing reviews for one particular company for the past 4 months now. Each month he wrote them 10 reviews.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n1ddox6cb20b1.png?width=2684&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c271d0eec4328cb78d7d2cb85dfffa3f9eb72f8

In another message, he tells me he’s offering the same services to 5 other companies. Doing some quick math:

5 companies x 10 reviews per company x $25 per review = $1,250 per month

Considering the average person in Pakistan earns $150 per month, that’s not bad change at all.

One of the companies that he’s offering his services to includes a Y-Combinator backed startup. I won’t name the company, but here’s what its average Glassdoor review rating distribution looks like:

https://preview.redd.it/2np5b6fdb20b1.png?width=2420&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8cafaa85453b0933a18eb5c30f931b3bb893c46

5 star reviews account for over 77% of the company’s total reviews. Obviously, no one is buying fake reviews that make them look bad.

But here’s the thing: freelancers are getting quite smart when it comes to writing reviews that don’t look too fishy. They tend to do this by spacing the reviews out (so that they don’t come in “spikes” – more on this later) and they also make sure that they’re not always leaving the “cons” section blank.

Don’t get me wrong, if you come across this company’s reviews, it’d be pretty easy to tell they’re quite strange. In fact, I can’t even post some screenshots here because it’d give the company away immediately.

But it would be challenging to conclude that the above company is buying reviews just by analyzing review volume and distribution without actually reading some of the reviews.

The same company is also buying reviews on Google Reviews.

Sidenote: I got curious about how he’s been writing 50 reviews from 50 different emails per month. Would he actually create 50 different email addresses? And what about the IP address – doesn’t Glassdoor flag multiple reviews from the same IP?

One of the freelancers answered my question:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g4id2yqeb20b1.png?width=2572&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2a77fdea8834a6d90f02b8b3eb67b3a874f3df2

Moving on – another company that seems to buy fake reviews seems to be having some more trouble. Approximately a month after a freelancer linked me to fake reviews he had written for this company, all five reviews that he had linked me to had been removed:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/99fdvcgfb20b1.png?width=3116&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7e244529fc62b5c824d925feb61fd2cc16cbfd5

Based on this [Glassdoor webinar](https://youtu.be/3iy0JWOS1gs) from 2018, “if it is found that a user has created multiple email accounts to submit reviews, then ALL submissions from that user are deleted” – so likely Glassdoor’s content moderation team flagged one of the initial reviews and the same freelancer who was writing reviews for that company had all the fake reviews deleted.

So far, it looks like the key to an effective fake review creation strategy lies in:

* Spacing the fake reviews out
* Writing each review from a different IP address (i.e benefit of being part of a team)
* Using language that isn’t an obvious giveaway

On that third point: the reality is that many of these freelancers’ first language is not English.

As an experiment, I turned to everybody’s favorite new toy, ChatGPT, and asked it to write me a positive Glassdoor review:

https://preview.redd.it/8w7cal9gb20b1.png?width=3164&format=png&auto=webp&s=860c39b11c5813e8b7fabdbb038d73c565cc98cf

And I’d say that the above answer was better than 95% of the fake reviews I came across.

**Removing reviews**

The process for removing an employer review usually works like this:

1. You identify one or multiple reviews that you want removed
2. You verify whether the review violates the site's Guidelines, or whether there’s something else about the review(s) that could get it removed.
3. You file an appeal to get it removed.

As an example, Glassdoor’s Review guidelines can be found [here](https://help.glassdoor.com/s/article/Community-Guidelines?language=en_US#:~:text=See%20More-,Review%C2%A0Guidelines,-Millions%20of%20job). Mainly, they forbid mentioning anyone by name who’s not an executive and revealing proprietary or confidential information, amongst a host of other things.

Sounds simple enough right? Well, according to one of the freelancers I messaged:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x6s8hsyac20b1.png?width=2036&format=png&auto=webp&s=f86c386f864198dc43faeb41faea378090c20107

After some research, I summarized the different vendors and prices in the table below:

&#x200B;

|Channel|Cost|Timeline|Model|Self reported success rate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Freelancer #1|$100 per review|3 days|Contingency Agreement Model|100%|
|Freelancer #2|$30 per review|7 days|Contingency Agreement Model|100%|
|Reputation management service #2|$450 per review|21 business days|Contingency Agreement Model|Unknown|
|Reputation management service #3|$1000 per review|Undefined|Contingency Agreement Model|100%|
|Reputation management service #4 Plan 1|$550 per review|5-6 weeks|Contingency Agreement Model|50-75%|
|Reputation management service #4 Plan 2|$300 Subscription + $100 per each review removed|Monthly service|Subscription plan|50-75%|
|Freelancer #3|$20|Undefined|Pay regardless|Undefined|
|Freelancer #4|$500|Undefined|Contingency Agreement Model|Undefined|

As you can see, unlike the fake review generation market, the prices vary quite a bit for getting reviews removed.

At one end, you have freelancers on gig marketplaces that will attempt to remove a review for less than $100. And then on the other end, you have ORMs (Online Reputation Management Agencies) that have multiple employees and more comprehensive packages in place. The one constant seems to be that most companies operate on a contingency agreement model (i.e pay only if review gets removed).

**Analyzing reviews**

ReviewMeta is a site that analyzes Amazon reviews and tells you how many are legitimate. The creator of the site, Tommy Noonan, mentions in an [interview with NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/06/27/623990036/episode-850-the-fake-review-hunter) that the main giveaway that a product is soliciting fake reviews is:

* A large, suspicious flood of positive reviews at the exact same time. For example, a 3 day stretch of time constituting 30% of total reviews.
* Phrases and words that are constantly repeated, especially in the section with no cons
* Brand monogamists (only review products from one company)

Whilst the last two bullets are hard to track, the first can be used to analyze different companies’ reviews and to check if there might be some funky business going on.

After a couple of days, I have the ability to track review volume and review ratings over time for any company that I specify:

https://preview.redd.it/ehcbw2oje20b1.png?width=1653&format=png&auto=webp&s=b448ff35eb9878fbb1686de2fa8cf031e4ed3e05

Let the games begin.

## Voluntary Response Bias

One of the biggest challenges that review platforms face is the Voluntary Response bias.

Research shows many of today’s most popular online review platforms (e.g Amazon) have a distribution of opinion that is highly polarized, with many extreme positive and/or negative reviews, and few moderate opinions.

Think about it: have you ever felt moderately satisfied at your job and thought to yourself, now would be a great time to leave a Glassdoor review? Probably not.

On the other hand, if you’ve had a terrible experience or even just had one thing really flip you off, you might be quite likely to leave an angry review.

Consider when a company goes through layoffs. You’re going to have a flood of angry reviews coming your way and are likely going to experience a “spike” in reviews.

**Note:** Just like the Wall Street Journal’s methodology described [here](https://archive.is/20201016094732/https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-manipulate-glassdoor-by-inflating-rankings-and-pressuring-employees-11548171977#selection-3965.0-3968.0), I considered there to be a spike if the total number of reviews in the month was greater than three standard deviations above the mean of the surrounding months.

Let’s take the company below. Here’s a graph of of their review volume since Jan 2020, including when they announced one of their first round of layoffs in June 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/n6kd9ejle20b1.png?width=3216&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eea2f3836617feca37eb88b1d3f67c8fa1b6fe2

In June 2022, approximately 19% of this company's 52 reviews were 1 star reviews (compared to an overall average of around 10%). This is what we could call a statistically significant spike in reviews. It also illustrates how the employees most likely to leave reviews are the ones that obviously had a bad experience (i.e getting laid off).

Here’s another company that had a similar spike in negative reviews due to layoffs in November 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/4vcnr1ine20b1.png?width=2408&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3877fb315ccc5d9a9294306a9f86616cb0fabd2

This company had an approximate 20% 1 star review rate (compared to an overall average of 12%) in November 2022, as well as an Avg Rating of 2.96 that month (compared to an overall average rating of 3.73).Unless HR is proactive, their reviews page risks succumbing to an echochamber of negative reviews that can really tilt one way.

**Note:** Glassdoor does state (based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iy0JWOS1gs) from 2017) that about 75% of the reviews on their platform are neutral. Their “give to get policy” has helped in keeping the platform from becoming too polarized.

I can understand why HR teams, like the ones that Nader talked to me about earlier, take a proactive stance towards managing their reviews. If they don’t try to control their reputation themselves, then their reputation risks getting controlled by the employees that had the worst possible experience.

## Goodhart’s Law

Goodhart’s law states the following:

*""When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure""*

Every October, Glassdoor publishes their Best Places To Work ranking.

In a [report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-manipulate-glassdoor-by-inflating-rankings-and-pressuring-employees-11548171977) that the WSJ did a couple of years ago, they found large spikes in the number of reviews that some companies (e.g SpaceX, Bain & Co, etc) got in September. The logic here is that some companies try to artificially inflate their Glassdoor reviews right before the October deadline.

I decided to revisit some of this analysis with Glassdoor’s 2023 Best Places To Work Ranking.

One of the companies I examined is rated as one of the best places to work in 2023. Let’s refer to this company as FunPlaceToWork.

Here is how their review volume looks like for all of 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/4e656zkqe20b1.png?width=2516&format=png&auto=webp&s=07141a66c56be7a6818efb9b1a4d912ee0021c91

FunPlaceToWork got around 50 reviews in September 2022. Of those 50 reviews, 96% were 5 star reviews.

FunPlaceToWork averaged 12 reviews per month up till then in 2022. Also, in the prior six months, the average percent of 5 star reviews received every month was \~75%.

Both the spike in volume of reviews and the spike in percentage of five star reviews are statistically significant.

I find it strange that Glassdoor’s proprietary algorithm and/or Human Content Moderation team did not find a spike of this nature unusual. If we look at Glassdoor’s eligibility criteria for the award, it’s as follows:

https://preview.redd.it/hag04y7se20b1.png?width=2868&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec2b920e126a8ea42b40d35aaa55d5341e69d022

The goal, according to Glassdoor, is to collect “authentic and unbiased reviews”.

Whilst there’s nothing against the rules for asking your employees to leave you reviews, I find the statistically significant spike of reviews at odds with the goal of collecting ""unbiased and authentic"" reviews (which Glassdoor states is the purpose of the awards).

Glassdoor states that an employer is allowed to ask its employees to leave reviews, but that they are not allowed to “coerce” them. Examples of what you can’t do:

* Offer incentives like Gift Cards in exchange for positive reviews.
* Withholding their reference letter unless they leave you a positive review.
* Anything that leads you to require proof for the employee to show you that they wrote a review.

It is possible to play by the rules (i.e not break any of the above rules) and to still in my opinion not collect authentic and unbiased reviews.

They say that you shouldn’t hate the player but the game – I think **FunPlaceToWork** played by the rules, won fair and square, and that this is simply a perfect example of Goodhart’s Law.

I reached out to Glassdoor ([awards@glassdoor.com](mailto:awards@glassdoor.com)) about the above and this is the reply I got:

https://preview.redd.it/x0dqq39ue20b1.png?width=4800&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0102c963be9486370b340f2f473cbc6650fc48a

**Conclusion**

When I was 22, on an [F1 visa with 3 months to find work](https://www.careerfair.io/job-hunt-story), I didn’t give a damn about bad reviews. I needed a job and I’d sign any piece of paper you put in front of me.

Compare that to someone at the peak of their career, someone with optionality and a multitude of job offers; an “A-Player”, as the experts call it, would absolutely have the luxury of choice and discard a job offer based on bad company reviews.

For most people, the impact of online company reviews lies somewhere in the middle. In marketing, there’s a concept of a “marketing touchpoint” - an interaction with the brand over the course of the whole buying journey.

Company reviews are one of the many touchpoints a job seeker experiences over their interview process. And with the technology industry booming the past couple of years, companies couldn’t afford to slack on any touchpoints, including this one.

After all, when others start to game the system, you’re at a disadvantage if you don’t. The rewards can be quite high. Certainly higher than just trying to be as transparent as possible.

HR leaders are often more incentivized to inflate their metrics than to get honest feedback. Fake review writers have bills to pay. ORMs know that companies are desperate. And the platforms, well, aren’t always paying attention.

The result is a potluck of interests that leads to an underground economy.

One that ends up hurting the job seeker.

Linear Regression is underrated,"Hey folks,

Wanted to share a quick story from the trenches of data science. I am not a data scientist but engineer however I've been working on a dynamic pricing project where the client was all in on neural networks to predict product sales and figure out the best prices using overly complicated setup. They tried linear regression once, didn't work magic instantly, so they jumped ship to the neural network, which took them days to train.

I thought, ""Hold on, let's not ditch linear regression just yet."" Gave it another go, dove a bit deeper, and bam - it worked wonders. Not only did it spit out results in seconds (compared to the days of training the neural networks took), but it also gave us clear insights on how different factors were affecting sales. Something the neural network's complexity just couldn't offer as plainly.

Moral of the story? Sometimes the simplest tools are the best for the job. Linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees might seem too basic next to flashy neural networks, but it's quick, effective, and gets straight to the point. Plus, you don't need to wait days to see if you're on the right track.

So, before you go all in on the latest and greatest tech, don't forget to give the classics a shot. Sometimes, they're all you need.

Cheers!

"I posted for a Data Analyst, this is what you are competing against","Our org needs a new data analyst, so I wrote up a job description with the skillset I needed and passed it off to our HR director to do what she needed and post it. I didn't put any degree requirement on it, I put responsibilities and real tools the new hire would be expected to work with. It is a remote role. I started looking for the posting, but couldn't find it, so I asked for a copy because my LinkedIn was getting attention indicating it existed somewhere.

I expected this response if I had posted for a Data Scientist role, but I didn't. I posted for a Data Analyst.

She took it down. There were 255 applicants in less than 24 hours. She sifted through half of them, excluded those who weren't already authorized to work in the US and those who didn't show English proficiency through their resume, and then forwarded me 9. I don't know that the 9 was all of the viable candidates that remained, they did seem to be biased to areas we have a footprint in the US, and I had just requested a sample.

Of those 9, 3 were absolutely new to the field. They put a data analytics certificate, but didn't even list which of the languages indicated on the posting they already knew. They didn't list any projects, just their previous work history (which was at best adjacent to the field). I looked up their certificates quickly and then moved on. List your technical skills - I'm not looking for ""good attitude, can learn"", I want to know how you've gotten yourself started in ways that are relevant to what I need. Your certificate only matters in what it taught you, not that you have it.

I had 4 that were on point. They had the skills I had listed and then a few, and they either had relevant work experience or a history of coursework (online or through universities) that showed they would have a good framework to start from.

Two were overqualified. Their experience was legitimately as data engineers. I assume they actually read the posting, so they remain in consideration, but their skills are beyond the specifics I need. I can't justify paying them more unless I can find ways that benefit the org to use those extra skills. I assume they will drop themselves from consideration when we talk more, so if I were in a time crunch, I would cut them from my list. Wishful thinking on getting a unicorn isn't a good use of my time.

I figured this was an opportunity for some perspective, seeing that we get ""what do I need to do to get a role"" posts all the time. I don't know what response I would have received if I had region locked this to around our HQ, or if we were offering hybrid or on-site work.

Just to add - I am not accepting resumes through here. I'm also ignoring anyone who finds my or my coworkers' LinkedIns and sends us resumes outside the standard process. I've already seen those happen.

&#x200B;

Edit to add: I also considered projects in the ""on point"" group - they showed they applied the skills.

Update: I checked with HR, the pay was included in the post. To be clear, it was mid-3rd quartile  for a Data Analyst position - we weren't posting anything with an amazing rate. It's very possible people submitted without reading the details, especially given the skill mismatches I see. I feel better about it, because I could not have written a more honest description of the role, so they had full information.

Also, 27 resumes were forwarded to me so far. I have sent 10 back for follow up, with another 5 to be written up on my side.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/13k8665/i_posted_for_a_data_analyst_this_is_what_you_are/

I timed how long it took me to go from “apply to job” to “submit application”.

Make no mistake: I sacrificed my soul for this post. I created over 83 accounts and spent a total of 11 hours scrolling. I was originally going to do this for 500 companies, but wanted to chop my head off halfway.

I did this for a mix of companies – Fortune 500 to early stage startups, spread out across different industries from software to manufacturing. The *type* of role I applied to was kept constant: engineering / product focused.

The outcome? An average of over two and a half minutes per application—162 seconds of your life you'll never get back. But as we dig deeper, you'll discover that these 162 seconds only scratch the surface of an often maddening process.

*Key Takeaways*

* **Average Application Time:** On average, it took a bit over two and a half minutes to apply to a job.
* **Company Size Impact:** If company size doubles, the application time increases by 5%. If company size increases by a factor of 10, then the app time increases by 20%.
* **Industry Influence:** Being a government company is the single largest determinant of a long application, followed closely by aerospace and consulting firms.
* **Longest Application:** The longest application time went to the United States Postal Service (10 minutes and 12 seconds).
* **Shortest Application:** On the other hand, It took me just 17 seconds to apply to Renaissance Technologies.
* **ATS Impact:** Older ATS like Workday and Taleo make job applications as much as 128% longer.

Let's dive in.

# The Setup

There’s no real method to the 250 companies I pick. I’m just typing names into Google and trying to vary it up. Where does Trisha work? What was that billboard I saw? It's all up for grabs.

Here’s the distribution of the 250 companies by size:

https://preview.redd.it/gv6r6xoqvyxb1.png?width=2420&format=png&auto=webp&s=6feb536781f5f892ff57aaed0033e716be4c25c4

Some examples of companies in each range:

* 1-500 → Glean, Quizlet, Gumroad
* 500-5,000 → Notion, Dolby, Moloco
* 5,000-50,000 → Airbnb, Genentech, Logitech
* 50,000-100,000 → HP, American Express, Pfizer
* 100,000+ → Wells Fargo, Lockheed Martin, General Motors

And here’s a look at the different types of industries represented:

I used a mix of Linkedin and Crunchbase for categorization.

# What makes a job application so frustrating

Generally speaking, the more frustrating a job application, the longer it takes to complete.

The three main factors that might influence how long a job application is (as measured in my data):

1. **Company size** → I would expect bigger companies to ask more questions.
2. **The ATS that is being used** → I would expect clunkier, older ATS to make job applications longer.
3. **Company industry** → I would expect more “traditional” industries to ask more questions.

We’re going to model the relationship between the above three factors and the amount of time it takes to complete a job application. To do this, we’re going to use a technique called linear regression.

Regression is about the way two measurements change together. It can help us make predictions.

For example, if I add 10 employees to a company, how many seconds will that add to the company’s job application process?

Since we have other factors like ATS and Industry, we will also account for those. For now, though, let’s just focus on each factor one by one.

# Company Size

Let’s first plot the data as is:

https://preview.redd.it/sdvfivrzvyxb1.png?width=3276&format=png&auto=webp&s=37d9d55db8d0fef37d0365c523a0c1ba7e3e4199

Yes, I know, this isn’t the most useful graph. I’m going to spruce it up real quick, I promise.

The United States Postal Service has a job application that took over 10 minutes to complete. Navigating their portal felt like using Internet Explorer in 2003:

https://preview.redd.it/40iu1ni2wyxb1.png?width=1604&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7b65699a39f2e4e3c3abadf38875280a673a0d7

Netflix’s application was just 20 seconds - their only mandatory requirements are your resume and basic info.

https://preview.redd.it/sl4fums4wyxb1.png?width=2310&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c0c87299460bd22163f34db1040a56ea3893059

Apple took me 71 seconds, still pretty fast for a company that has over 270,000 employees (PWC, which has a similar number of employees, took me almost six times as long).

Okay, back to the chart. There are a couple of problems with it.

First, the data is not linear. This is a problem if we want to use linear regression.

Second, the company size scale is hard to interpret because of the many data points clumped together near zero (representing all the smaller companies).

We can resolve both these issues with the following insight:

There is a big difference between going from 10 to 100 employees and, say, 10,000 to 10,100 employees. The first represents major changes in company structure: you might actually hire a proper HR team, a bunch of recruiters, and build out your candidate experience. The second, though, is pretty much just business as usual - think of a multinational opening up a satellite office or a regular month of hiring.

Since we want to account for this, our data is better suited to a log scale than a linear scale. I will also transform our Y-axis, the application time, to a log scale because it helps normalize the data.

If we plot both our variables on a log-log scale, we get the below chart:

https://preview.redd.it/5l4po6d8wyxb1.png?width=4304&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3199197ea1b608fc39b8c3626ab994dc9d5eb5e

Better right? This is the same data as the last chart, but with different axes that fits the data better, we observe a linear relationship.

We have the usual suspects in the top right: Government organizations, professional services firms, and some of the tech industry dinosaurs.

The variance in application times across smaller companies, like startups, is interesting. For example, many of the startups with longer application times (e.g OpenAI, Posthog, Comma.AI) reference that they are looking for “exceptional” candidates on their careers page. (Note that OpenAI has changed its application since I last analyzed it - it’s now much faster, but when I went through they asked for a mini essay on why you’re exceptional).

One thing that I was expecting to see was competitors mirroring each other’s application times. This is most closely represented with the consulting firms like Deloitte, E&Y, KPMG, etc all clumped together. McKinsey and Bain, the two most prestigious consulting firms, have applications that take longer to complete.

This doesn’t necessarily seem to be the case with the FAANG companies.

We can also calculate the correlation coefficient for this graph. This is a statistical measure of the strength of a linear relationship between two variables. The closer to 1 the value, the stronger the relationship.

For the above data, we get a correlation coefficient of 0.58, which is a moderate to strong association.

Note that on its own, this doesn't tell us anything about causation. But it does start to point us in some type of direction.

It's not rocket science: big companies ask for more stuff. Sometimes they ask for the last 4 digits of your SSN.

https://preview.redd.it/c7g5717bwyxb1.png?width=1512&format=png&auto=webp&s=38c776e46d45d179a6627ba3470fd4f89ca04204

Sometimes they even ask if you’d be okay going through a polygraph:

https://preview.redd.it/1q52rzldwyxb1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3b8921e055d38e04ee7395e9b982fa50c38f9df

An argument here is that if big companies didn’t have some sort of barriers in their application process, they’d get swarmed with applications.

Consider the fact that Google gets 3 million applications every year. Deloitte gets 2 million. Without some sort of initial friction in the application process, those numbers would be even higher. That friction almost serves as a reliable filter for interest.

If you’re an employer, you don’t really care about the people using a shotgun approach to apply. You want the candidates that have a real interest in the position. On the other hand, if you’re a candidate, the reality is such that the shotgun approach to apply is arguably the most efficient.

So we have this inherent tension between companies and candidates. Candidates want the most bang for their buck, companies don’t want thousands of irrelevant resumes.

And in the middle, we have the plethora of application tracking software that can often be quite old and clunky.

# ATS

Everytime I came face to face with a company that used Workday as their ATS, I died a bit inside. This is because Workday makes you:

1. create a new account every single time
2. redirects you away from the careers page

I defined a redirect as one when the job description is not listed on the same page as the first input box part of the application.

This isn’t a perfectly accurate measure, but it does allow us to differentiate between the modern ATS like Greenhouse and older ones like Workday.

With every ATS, I implicitly had some type of “how easy is this going to be” metric in my head.

We can try to represent this “how easy is this going to be” metric a bit more concretely using the matrix below.

https://preview.redd.it/bvpeu47iwyxb1.png?width=2200&format=png&auto=webp&s=818191eb4a0a5924c582f3ad7ec9539bc510f6fa

Ideally, you want the ATS to be in the bottom left corner. This creates an experience that is low friction and fast.

If we plot application time versus ATS, this is what we get:

https://preview.redd.it/pe9zyxmkwyxb1.png?width=3184&format=png&auto=webp&s=8df5c1118f9f0044e2154c8ae63816332ca42d67

The ATS that don’t make you create an account and don’t redirect you are tied to lower application times than the ones that do.

One possibility is that certain companies are more likely to use certain ATS. Big companies might use Workday for better compliance reporting. Same with the industry - maybe B2C software companies use the newer ATS on the market. These would be confounding variables, meaning that we may misinterpret a relationship between the ATS and the application time when in fact there isn’t one (and the real relationship is tied to the industry or size).

So to properly understand whether the ATS actually has an effect on application time, we need to control for our other variables. We’ll do this in the final section when we run a regression including all our variables.

One of the big frustrations surrounding different ATS is that when you upload your resume, you then need to retype out your experience in the boxes because the ATS resume parser did it incorrectly. For example, I went to UC Berkeley but sometimes got this:

https://preview.redd.it/ay21vccnwyxb1.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=9862b0860c49c87a76b02218f8e4118134acfb89

The only resume parser that didn't seem abysmal was the one from Smart Recruiters. TikTok's resume parser also isn't bad.

Another frustrating experience is tied to inconsistency between the company I'm applying to and the ATS.

https://preview.redd.it/9xzq21vpwyxb1.png?width=350&format=png&auto=webp&s=8432b293be4db0f58770760097df0117b53e667e

A company’s application process is often the first touchpoint you have with their brand. Startups competing for the best talent can't afford extra steps in their process. Apple and Facebook can.

Whilst the average time to complete a job application may only be 162 seconds, the fact that many ATS require steps like account creation and authentication can lead to application fatigue.

It’s not necessarily the explicit amount of time it takes, it’s the steps involved that drain you of energy and make you want to avoid applying to new jobs.

# Industry

Okay, so far we’ve looked at company size and the ATS as a loose indicator of what might make a job application frustrating. What about the company industry?

You would expect industries like banking or professional services to have longer application times, because getting those jobs revolves around having a bunch of credentials which they likely screen for (and ask you to submit) early on in the process.

On the other hand, internet startups I’d expect to be quick and fast. Let’s find out if this is true.

https://preview.redd.it/i7825ssvwyxb1.png?width=4012&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f51989a663cf7b8c664eacb983a9be0a8dbc80b

Hyped up industries like AI and Crypto have shorter application times. As expected, banks and consulting firms care about your GPA and ask you to submit it.

A government company has to basically verify your identity before they can even receive your application, so the process is entirely different and reflected in the submission time.

For many technology companies, the application process is almost like an extension of the company’s brand itself. For example, Plaid (an API first Fintech company), has a neat option where you can actually apply to the job via API:

https://preview.redd.it/px5k5wwxwyxb1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=d669e7e47e77e51d48a4867a2d06d27125617ed8

Roblox, a gaming company, allows people to submit job applications from within their [games](https://gamerant.com/roblox-company-interview-job-applicants-in-game/).

We also notice differences between legacy companies and their newer competitors. If we compare legacy banks versus neobanks (like Monzo, Mercury, etc), the legacy players averaged around 250 seconds per job application whereas the neobanks averaged less than 60 seconds.

If you can’t compete on prestige, you need to find other ways. One of those ways can be through asking for less information upfront.

# Putting it together

Now that we've analyzed each variable - the company size, ATS, and the industry - to understand the separate relationship of each to application time, we can use linear regression to understand the *combined* relationships.

This will allow us to determine what factors actually have an impact on the job application time versus which ones might just have had one when we looked at them in isolation.

After some number crunching in R, I get the following results (I’ve only added the statistically significant factors – the ones with the “strongest evidence”):

https://preview.redd.it/g2pg1o11xyxb1.png?width=2496&format=png&auto=webp&s=2efc92ad2cfa4aaf25297d23c228d0c7343729f9

Here’s how you can interpret some of the information above:

* When a job app is for a company that is within the Government industry, the submission time goes up by 366% (assuming the size and ATS are constant). For the aerospace industry, this is 249% (and so on).
* When a job app is for a company using the Workday ATS, the submission times goes up by 128% (assuming the size and industry are constant). For the Phenom ATS, this is 110% (and so on).
* Our only (statistically significant) metric which seems to make job applications faster is the Lever ATS (42% shorter).

Okay, now what about company size?

Well, first up: company size is indeed statistically significant. So there is an effect.

However, its effect is not as strong as most of our other variables. To be precise, here are some ways to interpret our company size coefficient:

* If company size doubles, the app size increases by 5%
* If company size increases by a factor of 10, then the app time increases by 20%

This is a smaller effect size compared to ATS or industry (a 20% increases in app time for a 10x large company is a qualitatively smaller effect size than e.g. a 100% increase in app time for Taleo ATS). So although company size is statistically significant, it is not as strong of a driver as ATS and industry of app time.

# Wrapping it up

Two and a half minutes might not be too long, but it can feel like an eternity when you’re forced to answer the same questions and upload the same documents. Over and over again.

Think about catching a flight. All you want is to get on the jet. Hawaii awaits.

But first: the security line. You have to take your shoes off. You get patted down and your bag gets searched. The gate numbers don’t make sense. And then at the end of it, your flight’s delayed. Congrats.

Applying to a job can feel similar. All you want to do is say aloha to the hiring manager, a real human being.

To even have the remote possibility of making that happen, you need to create an account and password, check your email, retype your entire resume, tell them the color of your skin, and explain why this company you’ve never heard of before is the greatest thing on Earth.

And for what? Most likely for the privilege of receiving an automated email about two weeks later rejecting you.

If we make it tiring and unappealing to look for new opportunities, then we prevent people from doing their best work.

But what would a world where applying took just a few seconds actually look like? Recruiters would get bombarded with resumes. It's possible to argue that job applications taking so long is a feature, not a bug. You get to filter for intent and narrow down your application pool.

Is it fair to shift the burden of screening unqualified candidates onto good candidates that now need to provide so much information? Shouldn’t that burden fall on the recruiter?

The truth is that applying to a job via the careers page is a bit of a rigged game. The odds are not in your favor.

Sometimes, though, all you need is to only be right once.

A data scientist got caught lying about their project work and past experience during interview today,"I was part of an interview panel for a staff data science role. The candidate had written a really impressive resume with lots of domain specific project work experience about creating and deploying cutting-edge ML products. They had even mentioned the ROI in millions of dollars. The candidate started talking endlessly about the ML models they had built, the cloud platforms they'd used to deploy, etc. But then, when other panelists dug in, the candidate could not answer some domain specific questions they had claimed extensive experience for. So it was just like any other interview.

One panelist wasn't convinced by the resume though. Turns out this panelist had been a consultant at the company where the candidate had worked previously, and had many acquaintances from there on LinkedIn as well. She texted one of them asking if the claims the candidate was making were true. According to this acquaintance, the candidate was not even part of the projects they'd mentioned on the resume, and the ROI numbers were all made up. Turns out the project team had once given a demo to the candidate's team on how to use their ML product.

When the panelist shared this information with others on the panel, the candidate was rejected and a feedback was sent to the HR saying the candidate had faked their work experience.

This isn't the first time I've come across people ""plagiarizing"" (for the lack of a better word) others' project works as their's during interview and in resumes. But this incident was wild. But do you think a deserving and more eligible candidate misses an opportunity everytime a fake resume lands at your desk? Should HR do a better job filtering resumes?

Edit 1: Some have asked if she knew the whole company. Obviously not, even though its not a big company. But the person she connected with knew about the project the candidate had mentioned in the resume. All she asked was whether the candidate was related to the project or not. Also, the candidate had already resigned from the company, signed NOC for background checks, and was a immediate joiner, which is one of the reasons why they were shortlisted by the HR. 

Edit 2: My field of work requires good amount of domain knowledge, at least at the Staff/Senior role, who're supposed to lead a team. It's still a gamble nevertheless, irrespective of who is hired, and most hiring managers know it pretty well. They just like to derisk as much as they can so that the team does not suffer. As I said the candidate's interview was just like any other interview except for the fact that they got caught. Had they not gone overboard with exxagerating their  experience, the situation would be much different.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/1bj9cvc/a_data_scientist_got_caught_lying_about_their/
Anyone else been mildly horrified once they dive into the company's data?,"I'm a few months into my first job as a data analyst at a mobile gaming company. We make freemium games where users can play for awhile until they run out of coins/energy then have to wait varying amounts of time, like ""You're out of coins. Wait 10 minutes for new coins, or you can buy 100 coins now for $12.99.""

So I don't know what I was expecting, but the first time I saw how much money some people spend on these games I felt like I was going to throw up. Most people never make a purchase. But some people spend insane amounts of money. Like upsetting amounts of money.

There's one lady in Ohio who spent so much money that her purchases alone could pay for the salaries of our entire engineering department. And I guess they did?

There's no scenario in which it would make sense for her to spend that much money on a mobile game. Genuinely I'm like, the only way I would not feel bad for this lady is if she's using a stolen credit card and fucking around because it's not really her money.

Anyone else ever seen things like this while working as a data analyst?

\*Edit: Interesting that the comment section has both people saying-

1. Of course the numbers are that high; ""whales"" spend a lot of money on mobile games.
2. The numbers can't possibly be that high; it must be money laundering or pipeline failures.

Both made me feel oddly validated though, so thank you.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/13o7m3d/anyone_else_been_mildly_horrified_once_they_dive/
A small rant - The quality of data analysts / scientists,"I work for a mid size company as a manager and generally take a couple of interviews each week, I am frankly exasperated by the shockingly little knowledge even for folks who claim to have worked in the area for years and years.

&#x200B;

1. People would write stuff like LSTM , NN , XGBoost etc. on their resumes but have zero idea of what a linear regression is or what p-values represent. In the last 10-20 interviews I took, not a single one could answer why we use the value of 0.05 as a cut-off (Spoiler - I would accept literally any answer ranging from defending the 0.05 value to just saying that it's random.)
2.  Shocking logical skills, I tend to assume that people in this field would be at least somewhat competent in maths/logic, apparently not - close to half the interviewed folks can't tell me how many cubes of side 1 cm do I need to create one of side 5 cm.
3. Communication is exhausting - the words ""explain/describe **briefly**"" apparently doesn't mean shit - I must hear a story from their birth to the end of the universe if I accidently ask an open ended question.
4. Powerpoint creation / creating synergy between teams doing data work is not data science - please don't waste people's time if that's what you have worked on unless you are trying to switch career paths and are willing to start at the bottom.
5. Everyone claims that they know ""**advanced excel**"" , knowing how to open an excel sheet and apply =SUM(?:?) is not advanced excel - you better be aware of stuff like offset / lookups  / array formulas / user created functions / named ranges etc. if you claim to be advanced.
6. There's a massive problem of not understanding the ""**why?**"" about anything - why did you replace your missing values with the medians and not the mean? Why do you use the elbow method for detecting the amount of clusters? What does a scatter plot tell you (hint - In any real world data it doesn't tell you shit - I will fight anyone who claims otherwise.) - they know how to write the code for it, but have absolutely zero idea what's going on under the hood.

There are many other frustrating things out there but I just had to get this out quickly having done 5 interviews in the last 5 days and wasting 5 hours of my life that I will never get back.

For many years, the main extension to represent arrays and perform operations on them in a fast way has been NumPy. And this is what pandas was initially built on.  
>  
>While NumPy has been good enough to make pandas the popular library it is, it was never built as a backend for dataframe libraries, and it has some important limitations.

**Summary of improvements include:**

* **Managing missing values:** By using Arrow, pandas is able to deal with missing values without having to implement its own version for each data type. Instead, the Apache Arrow in-memory data representation includes an equivalent representation as part of its specification
* **Speed:** Given an example of a dataframe with 2.5 million rows running in the author's laptop, running the `endswith` function is 31.6x fasters using Apache Arrow vs. Numpy (14.9ms vs. 471ms, respectively)
* **Interoperability:** Ingesting a data in one format and outputting it in a different format should not be challenging. For example, moving from SAS data to Latex, using Pandas <2.0 would require:
   * Load the data from SAS into a pandas dataframe
   * Export the dataframe to a parquet file
   * Load the parquet file from Polars
   * Make the transformations in Polars
   * Export the Polars dataframe into a second parquet file
   * Load the Parquet into pandas
   * Export the data to the final LATEX file  
However, with PyArrow, the operation can be as simple as such (after Polars bug fixes and using Pandas 2.0):

&#8203;

    loaded_pandas_data = pandas.read_sas(fname) 
    
    polars_data = polars.from_pandas(loaded_pandas_data) 
    # perform operations with pandas polars 
    
    to_export_pandas_data = polars.to_pandas(use_pyarrow_extension_array=True) to_export_pandas_data.to_latex()

* **Expanding Data Type Support:**

>Arrow types are broader and better when used outside of a numerical tool like NumPy. It has better support for dates and time, including types for date-only or time-only data, different precision (e.g. seconds, milliseconds, etc.), different sizes (32 bits, 63 bits, etc.). The boolean type in Arrow uses a single bit per value, consuming one eighth of memory. It also supports other types, like decimals, or binary data, as well as complex types (for example a column where each value is a list). There is [a table](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/reference/arrays.html?highlight=arrowdtype#pyarrow) in the pandas documentation mapping Arrow to NumPy types.

I am Jack's Complete Lack of Job Satsifaction,"I was hired so they could have a data person. Half the time they call me a data scientist, the rest of the time it's either data analyst or data guru.
But they have only a teeny amount of data with a ravenous hyena guarding it like gollum with his precious. 
They pay me decently to rot away doing nothing. No access to data and no access to customers.  It's been almost a year, I've taken dozens of courses on everything data-related. I've read books, articles, white papers. Nothing is sticking anymore, without application, I'm not retaining what I'm trying to learn.
Some days are worse than others, like today, staring at the screen in a mindless haze. Watching my life get closer to the end, one minute at a time.
I'm losing my will to live in this entropic ennui. 
I can't even read job descriptions with any amount of interest. 


Just needed to vent, thank you for attending my Ted Talk.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/1bcpfuc/i_am_jacks_complete_lack_of_job_satsifaction/
It's not just you. Everyone hates the return to office,"Somehow, I am lucky enough to land a completely remote role, 100% virtual because the rest of my team is virtual based but I still have to go into the office at least 12 times a year for bogus meetings to sit in a conference room while we all use WebEx, totally immersive right? But we have frequent meetings with other people in our field, data scientists, engineers, architects, etc. They are all back in office 4 days a week, and each of them has this ashy tone, they grudgingly hate being in the office, despise it, because who wants to go to a stuffy office?


Here are the top complaints that I have noticed from people about being in office

- The commute is terrible. Some people have to commute as much as 50 minutes one way, and that's not including traffic. That's crazy. You're not getting paid for that. That's free labor and travel for your company


- The office is incredibly distracting. Cubicles are typically open, so people can freely walk up and talk to you, make eye contact with you which starts a conversation, but you're still under the same time crunch you were when you worked from home completely isolated in your nice office away from everyone else


- ""Collaborative spaces"" and ""focus areas"" are bullsh*t. So many nice little desks, nooks, rooms for you to go to to focus or meet with others. But here's the thing, you never see anyone using those because I guess where they are? At their desk, working, constantly. No one ever has the time to use them. My office is so incredibly nice, and every time I walk around, I feel like I'm the only one taking a walk because I see everyone glued to their desks

- You're distracted constantly by others who are at different levels than you. The only way I figured out that there is some college intern making twice as much as I am doing a little bit more than me is by speaking to people in the immediate vicinity of my desk. Machine learning engineer versus data scientist. The difference? They use a little bit more power platform, a couple more tools, 20 more lines of Python a day. Congrats, here is 40K more for you. This can be very distracting, because you see these people all the time


- NO PRODUCTIVITY OR OTHER GAIN. Literally no benefit or gain from being back in the office. Just disgruntled people


- office supplies are shit. At home, I have an ultra wide monitor that I also use for personal PC gaming so I can just literally KVM switch it over. I have a modded gaming mouse and keyboard, a $200 Logitech pro headset with superior sound quality and microphone. You know what I don't have at the office? Any of this stuff. Yeah. A $5 Logitech mouse and keyboard that is extremely noisy and uncomfortable has no ergonomics at all. Office chairs are not ergonomic They are just the cheapest they could get. Uncomfortable $0.90 headsets and webcams


- MANDATORY extracurricular events and activities in or outside of work. Yes, this is real. After hours socials, restaurants, social outings. These are disguised as optional, but you will often get bullied teased or pressured into them. This also does not grant you any leeway during any project, you still have to get all work and projects done with this loss of time",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/16vaaco/its_not_just_you_everyone_hates_the_return_to/
Warning to would be master’s graduates in “data science”,"I teach data science at a university (going anonymous for obvious reasons). I won't mention the institution name or location, though I think this is something typical across all non-prestigious universities. Basically, master's courses in data science, especially those of 1 year and marketed to international students, are a scam. 

Essentially, because there is pressure to pass all the students, we cannot give any material that is too challenging. I don't want to put challenging material in the course because I want them to fail--I put it because challenge is how students **grow** and **learn**. Aside from being a data analyst, being even an entry-level data scientist requires being good at a lot of things, and knowing the material deeply, not just superficially. Likewise, data engineers have to be good software engineers.

But apparently, asking the students to implement a trivial function in Python is too much. Just working with high-level libraries won't be enough to get my students a job in the field. OK, maybe you don’t have to implement algorithms from scratch, but you have to at least wrangle data. The theoretical content is OK, but the practical element is far from sufficient.

It is my belief that only one of my students, a software developer, will go on to get a high-paying job in the data field. Some might become data analysts (which pays thousands less), and likely a few will never get into a data career.

Universities write all sorts of crap in their marketing spiel that bears no resemblance to reality. And students, nor parents, don’t know any better, because how many people are actually qualified to judge whether a DS curriculum is good? Nor is it enough to see the topics, you have to see the *assignments*. If a DS course doesn’t have at least one serious course in statistics, any SQL, and doesn’t make you solve real programming problems, it's no good.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/17798wz/warning_to_would_be_masters_graduates_in_data/

A harsh truth about data science....,"Broadly speaking, the job of a data scientist is to use data to understand things, create value, and inform business decisions. It it *not necessarily* to implement and utilize advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques. That's not to say that you can't or won't use ML/AI to inform business decisions, what I'm saying is that it's not always required to. Obviously this is going to depend on your company, their products, and role, but let's talk about a quintessential DS position at a quintessential company.

I think the problem a lot of newer or prospective Data Scientists run into is that they learn all these advanced techniques and want to start using them right away. They apply them anywhere they can, kind of shoehorning them in and not having a clear idea of what it is they are even trying to accomplish in the first place. In other words, the tools lead the problem. Of course, the way it should be is that the problem leads the tools. I'm coming to find for like 50+% of the things I'm asked to do, a time series visualization, contingency tables, and histograms are sufficient to answer the question to the satisfaction of the business leaders. That's it. We're done, on to the next one. Start simple, if the simple techniques don't answer the question, then move on to the more advanced stuff. I speak from experience, of course.

In my opinion, understanding when to use simple tools vs when to break out the big guns is way harder then figuring out how to use the big guns. Even harder still is taking your findings and translating them into actual, actionable insights that a business can use. Okay, so you built a multi-layer CNN that models customer behavior? That's great, but what does the business do with it? For example, can you use it to identify customers who might buy more product with more advertising? Can you put a list of those customers on the CEO's desk? Could a simple regression model have done the same in 1/4 of the time? These are skills that take years to learn and so it's totally understandable for newer or prospective DSs to not have them. But they do not seem to be emphasized in a lot of degree programs or MOOCs. It seems to me like they just hand you a dataset and tell you what to do with it. It's great that you can use the tools they tell you to on it, but you're missing out on the identifying which tools to even use part in the first place.

Just my 2c.

125k offer as a data scientist but I have no idea what a data scientist does,"Hey so I recently got a new grad job offer as a data scientist with TC about 125k in Dallas, Texas. But I have never really done data science before in my life and I'm a little worried about going in there and just complete flopping. My statistics teacher made the class wayyyy too easy so I'm really going in with only a little knowledge. I barely know what a standard deviation is.

I have worked on projects as an intern software developer where I built a tool which helps people who do data analysis but I don't actually know how to do any of it myself. I think the hiring manager was more impressed with what I can do in software development, but the job description was tons of what looks like traditional DS stuff.

6 months as a Data Science freelancer,"I have been a freelance Data Scientist for 6 month and I have more job offers than I can manage (I turn down offers every week). 

Some people have written me to get some tips on how to start and get some clients. 
So these are a few things I tried to find clients on Upwork, LinkedIn and in online communities.

1) Look for projects on Upwork. 
Set up a nice profile, showcase your project portfolio, research the market, bid on several projects and be willing to set a cheap rate at the beginning. 
You won't make much money the first month, but you will get exposure, your Upwork rating will improve and you can start to bid on some higher paying jobs. 
In 6 months my rate went up 4 times, so don't think it takes so long to get to a good hourly rate. 

2) Improve and polish your LinkedIn profile. 
Many recruiters will write you here. 
Insert the right keywords on your profile, document your previous work, post something work related every week, if you can. 
This is a long game but pays off because instead of bidding for jobs, in the end the recruiters will start to write you.

3) Join online communities of entrepreneurs.
There are several small businesses that look for Data experts and beyond. They have projects ongoing and want to hire freelancers for a short time. 
You can meet them in these communities. Look for them on Twitter, Discord, Slack, Reddit...
Engage with them, share what you do and soon you will start to get some interest. This type of interaction quickly turns into job opportunities.

4) Write. 
Just create a blog and post regularly. Post about what you do, the tools you have used and so on. Better to post a tutorial, a new tech you tried out, a small model you developed. 
All the successful people I know have this habit. They write and share what they do regularly.

5) Put yourself out there and interact online. 
Maybe one day you share something and it gets retweeted, maybe you pick up a good SEO keyword in your blog, you never know. That's why it's important to increase your exposure. You will increase your chances of getting noticed and potentially land a new client.

6) Be generous 
Once you do the above soon you will be noticed and people will start to contact you. 
They will not offer you a contract. That's not how it works. after all, they don't know you and they don't trust you. But something you wrote hit them. Probably they will ask for your help and advice on a specific issue. 
Give advice on the tech to use, how to solve a problem, how to improve their processes, give as much as you can, be honest and open. Say all you know and you will build trust. 
It's the start of a professional relationship.

7) Be patient
Not all conversations will turn into a job opportunity. Sometimes they lead nowhere, sometimes there is no budget, sometimes it takes months to sign a contract. In my experience maybe 2-3 out of 10 conversations turn into a job offer. 
Accept it. It's normal.

However, now they are just trying to shoehorn gen AI wherever they can for the sake of the investors. They are not making rational decisions anymore. They aren't even asking me about it anymore. Some exec wakes up one day and has a crazy misguided idea about sticking gen AI somewhere and then asking junior (non DS) devs to build it without DS input. All the while, traditional ML is actually making the company money, projects are going well, but getting ignored. Does this sound familiar?

Name & Shame: Carlyle Group Investment Data Science,"I think we're due for a name & shame! Sharing my experience in case it's helpful for future applicants.

# Company & Role

The Carlyle Group is a Private Equity mega-fund. They essentially buy and flip companies like a real estate investor buys and flips houses. They've recently (in the past few years) spun up a data science org. My understanding is that the responsibilities of this role would entail assisting the deal team in commercial due diligences of prospective investments, assisting in portfolio operations and consulting on advanced analytics for the portfolio companies, as well as company wide data science initiatives. My impression was that this role would not be very involved in deal sourcing.

# My Background

* FAANG Senior DS
* Worked in management consulting in the past - primarily as a data science consultant for Silicon Valley tech companies but also did a commercial due diligence project with our M&A practice as a DS consultant
* Ivy League masters in CS / Top 20 undergrad

# Application Process & Experience

* I first cold applied online
* After a short period of time I received an email from a Carlyle recruiter with a link to a 2 hour Hackerrank exam. I did not first receive any introductory call or even an introductory email - just an email with a URL to Hackerrank.
* I decided to take the exam. It consisted of:
   * One SQL (medium / window functions)
   * One Python (leetcode easy)
   * Discrete probability (e.g. probability of making a full house if you randomly draw 5 cards from a standard deck)
   * Domain specific data science questions (e.g. how would you apply data science to this private equity problem)
   * Overall I felt comfortable with all aspects of the exam and felt that it was well within my wheelhouse
* After completing the exam I sent a note to the recruiter. They scheduled a call with the ""senior recruiter"" for end of week
* The call with senior recruiter was fairly standard and covered the nature of the team, responsibilities of the role, and my background. I thought the call went well and was under the impression that I'd be moving forward in the process  (though I've learned never to take what recruiters say at face value)
* At the end of the call the senior recruiter asked if I had taken the Hackerrank exam yet. I was a bit surprised that they did not already know the answer to that question.
* After exactly one week of radio silence since the initial call, I emailed the first recruiter to let them know that I had seen some progress in my other searches (true) and asked if my application was still in consideration. I did not receive a response to this email.
* I waited one more week (two weeks since the initial call and about three weeks since I took the exam) and emailed the senior recruiter for a status update. I didn't receive a response to this email either but will edit this post if they ever do respond.

# Conclusion

* At this point I've concluded that I've been ghosted. I can only speculate as to why. I'm leaning towards them just being highly disorganized.
* For future applicants I strongly, strongly advise not taking their HackerRank exam unless you don't mind having your time wasted. I'm willing to bet nobody at Carlyle even looked at my test responses.

\*\*EDIT\*\*

It seems a lot of you think that ghosting is professionally acceptable. If you're investing your time, the bare minimum is a courtesy email to let you know you won't be moving forward in the process.

This was all automated. Like, I was shocked that anyone would be doing something so silly, and ridiculous.

My F100 company analyzed why our good data scientists are good and here's the recap,"A small team of internal researchers inside the company spent time investigating which data scientists preformed the best, which preformed the worst, and what factors played into this. 

The top 3 indicators of a high preforming data scientist were:
1. The number one predictor of a preformant data scientist was proactive communication. Be it speaking up in meetings, pinging people in chat, voicing concerns with a work plan, these data scientists communicated on their own initiative and their ability to get things done and make an impact is recognized. 
2. They are capable of flushing out requirements and working on complicated tasks without managerial intervention. A good example of this could be manager says we need to build a model that satisfies xyz objectives and that there are additional business reqs we'll need to flush out. 2 or 3 data scientists go do all the work to get the data and flush out the requirments while making all the plans amongst themselves and basically just keeping the manager in the loop on what's happening. 
3. They focus on adding value over pursuing technical solutions. Often times the simpler modeling approach is good enough and it solves the problem in a quick fashion. 


Things noted about low preforming data scientists were:
1. They were reactive in their communication
2. They often times missed deadlines that they themselves set and never communicated that there were issues or that the deadline would be missed. 
3. They often focus on tasks like attending all of their meetings or immediatly responding to emails rather than meeting project goals and deadlines
4. They focus too much on perfecting the POC solution which later leads to a lot of rework / wasted time.
5. They're overly dismissive in their communication. Weather it be asking for feedback and validation and then disregarding it when it doesn't align with their ideas or simply dismissing the ideas of others in general. 
6. They create drama.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/16x6t1p/my_f100_company_analyzed_why_our_good_data/
Failed an interviewee because they wouldn't shut up about LLMs at the end of the interview,"Last week was interviewing a candidate who was very borderline. Then as I was trying to end the interview and let the candidate ask questions about our company, they insisted on talking about how they could use LLMs to help the regression problem we were discussing. It made no sense. This is essentially what tipped them from a soft thumbs up to a soft thumbs down.

R vs Python - detailed examples from proficient bilingual programmers,"As an academic, R was a priority for me to learn over Python. Years later, I always see people saying ""Python is a general-purpose language and R is for stats"", but I've never come across a single programming task that couldn't be completed with extraordinary efficiency in R. I've used R for everything from big data analysis (tens to hundreds of GBs of raw data), machine learning, data visualization, modeling, bioinformatics, building interactive applications, making professional reports, etc.

Is there any truth to the dogmatic saying that ""Python is better than R for general purpose data science""? It certainly doesn't appear that way on my end, but **I would love some specifics for how Python beats R in certain categories as motivation to learn the language.** For example, if R is a statistical language and machine learning is rooted in statistics, how could Python possibly be any better for that?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/16dk5b6/r_vs_python_detailed_examples_from_proficient/

Here's the problem : I feel so disconnected & unpassionate about my job. It's partially an imposter syndrome issue. Looking at my skillset compared to other data scientists & those who are passionate about Data Science - I'm losing pace. My peers who care about this type of work are deeply involved in improved learning - new Python libraries, new modeling techniques. Everyone in this profession have a strong desire to learn & improve. This has really never been me. I was able to succeed in the mid to late 2010's being fresh out of school & having an ""up to date"" skillset ... but I don't think I have the drive or desire to do what I have to do to keep up in the mid to late 2020's.  

I feel like I fell into this career out of the start of my career, but now a few months away from 30 I'm questioning if this is what I want my next 25 years of work to be. I have friends, family and colleagues who are passionate & driven about work. I feel like this was the career I fell into because of my Math degree. I really don't know what it is I'm passionate about, but working as a data scientist in the financial sector for the next 25 years isn't it (or maybe being a data scientist at all). 

At the same time, I don't want to start my career fresh at the age of 30. I think I'm a naturally analytical person, and want to be able to carry over some of the skills I've picked up from the last 8 years into a new role, that might bring more passion & joy back into my job. 

So, I wanted to see if others on this sub have gone through the same thing. If yes - what were some stories you have that I can use as inspiration? Are there career options out there for ex Data Scientists who don't want to be technical code monkeys anymore, that can leverage some of our analytical backgrounds to thrive?

Thanks, look forward to hearing some stories",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/149ea3x/i_dont_want_to_be_a_data_scientist_anymore/
Interviewing is terrible now. They don't treat you with any respect anymore,"I was laid off from my company earlier this year after 1.8 years of successful work experience at this company. I was recognized three times over that period, given merit increases in bonuses, shares of stock as rewards. Constantly praised and recognized several times, and never disciplined in any way or even told that my performance was an issue. I was laid off and they admitted that it was not for performance reasons, I was a great employee, they would love to see me work for them again...

So I start reapplying, I'm very dedicated to working for this company, and the interviews that I get are much more challenging than they were when I started with the company. Previously, they asked me about my background, skills, experience, and had me interview with other people on the team. This time around, I had to do case studies that were extremely challenging. One of them I had 3 hours to go through an absurdly complex Excel assignment that involved three separate spreadsheets of data and building a data lookup tool using Excel. Like, creating a tableau report, just using data validation and dropdowns and stuff and conditional formatting I guess? Sounds stupid and I've never done something so crazy so yep I failed hard. Also had another interview based around SQL, which I know like the back of my hand. Aced the interview, and almost got an offer, but disqualified last round.

Then I had another interview for BI engineer position, and they were “disappointed” with me for not speaking to what SQL I’d used. The manager was honestly a douche, I could tell just from his demeanor, and how he acted. Dude seemed like he was barely invested in the interview. It was supposed to be a meet and greet, NOT an interview, that’s verbatim what I was told. Then I get told I should’ve explained size of my SQL queries, how many rows, types of joins. Like uh, it’s a meet and greet to learn more about the role, and YOU did not ask ME any of that either?

It’s just so infuriating.... 3 years ago, we had 1-3 interviews for low to mid level jobs. Now its 3-8 interviews minimum plus 2+ case studies, for ANY JOB. Like, imagine working for a company and being praised for years, now because of ""economic conditions"" hundreds get laid off, and treated like children in interviews to rejoin the firm. This is just sad. ",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/1802ydm/interviewing_is_terrible_now_they_dont_treat_you/

Why is there no interest in Business Analytics?,"My job title is Analytics Manager and I work for a large company that has a formal Business Intelligence/Data Science department. In this org, we are split into 3 parts: 1) Data Engineering, 2) Data Science, and 3) Business Analytics

Data Engineering builds the data pipelines, ETLs, and manages the data warehouse. Data Science works on very specific projects like recommender, search, and customer churn models.

Meanwhile Business Analytics is like the business jobs that are also technical. Their job can be dashboarding, executive reporting, strategy insights, market analytics, etc. but they have to know a lot of SQL and some programming in order to extract the data and transform it into insights. They also need to know business context. It’s like 50% coding and 50% making financial models and/or PowerPoint decks for execs.

When we interview people, especially interns and younger candidates, nobody wants to do BA. Everyone wants to do DS. The ironic thing is the DS jobs are the fewest in quantity and they only hire the most qualified people (usually people with PhDs). All the DE people have backgrounds in CS and the BA people have backgrounds like people on this sub where they usually have a MS in DS or Analytics.

It just seems like the BA jobs are off putting to many candidates. As soon as I mention PowerPoint or excel, I can feel their souls die lol. The truth is it’s part of the job, but there’s more to it than that. I code a lot, I grab data from APIs, I go through developer docs, but yes, I also build decks and am good at it. I think there’s more jobs in this sector and more upside for promotions and job opportunities. So why do people frown on BA?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/14ivufl/why_is_there_no_interest_in_business_analytics/
I hate PowerPoint,"I know this is a terrible thing to say but every time I'm in a room full of people with shiny Powerpoint decks and I'm the only non-PowerPoint guy, I start to feel uncomfortable. I have nothing against them. I know a lot of them are bright, intelligent people. It just seems like such an agonizing amount of busy work: sizing and resizing text boxes and images, dealing with templates, hunting down icons for flowcharts, trying to make everything line up the way it should even though it never really does--all to see my beautiful dynamic dashboards reduced to static cutouts. Bullet points in general seem like a lot of unnecessary violence.

Any tips for getting over my fear of ppt...sorry pptx? An obvious one would be to learn how to use it properly but I'd rather avoid that if possible.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/1b4cxc2/i_hate_powerpoint/
Job is a nightmare - Advice,"Hi. I'm 24F. Recently finished my masters in statistics. Interested in data science and miraculously I was hired to do analysis for two large companies under the same parent group. I was super excited but 3 months later. I'm miserable. 

I thought I would've been able to take some data and clean it up and do some cool analysis on it. But it's so much. I can't handle this. I have to keep track of customer and sales data for two large companies. Most of the data isn't even clean. There's about 5 platforms to keep track of for each. There's stupid meetings every day. Presentations for each company every week. And then in-between that I have to find time to do my own work. I have no personal time. My relationship died.

My boss is an absolute nightmare. A stereotypical corporate bro. The most emotionless uncaring blunt workaholic person I've ever met. I can do nothing right in his eyes. I've never received a list of specific tasks to do. Sometimes I give him insights into some data and he ignores it. I don't care for a bunch of emotional shit but a little bit of empathy or something. And then they're telling me about their plans for me long term in the company and they've already sent me on a trip abroad for training.

I just wanted to use some sales/customer data and do some analysis man. This is too much. How do I even navigate this?

Edit:  HI. I got some good advice in here and some bad. Thank you for all.

PSA for those who can’t find work.,"Local Health departments are historically un-modern in technological solutions due to decades of underfunding before the pandemic.

Today post pandemic, Health sectors are being infused from the government with millions of grant dollars to “modernize technologies so they are better prepared for the next crisis.

These departments most of the time have zero infrastructure for data. Most of the workforce works in Excel and stores data in the Microsoft shared drive. Automation is non existent and report workflows are bottlenecked which crippled decision making by leadership.

Health departments have money and need people like you to help them modernize data solutions. It’s not a six figure job. It is however job security with good benefits and your contributions go far to help communities and feels rewarding.

If you can not find work, look at your city or county job boards in the Health Department.

Today i saw a job ad on Linkedin and decide to apply it.  They gave me 30 python questions (not algorithms) and i manage to do answer 2 of them.

My self perception shuttered and i feel like i am missing a lot.  I have couple of projects i am working on and therefore not much time for enjoying life.  How much i should sacrifice more ?  I know i can learn a lot if i want to . But I am gonna be 30 years old tomorrow and I dont know how much more i should grind.

Today I had a beautiful moment that I had to share,"This is going to be somewhat long. I apologize but I have to share. 

Last summer, completely against my will, I was told that I had to manage a high school intern who was in a program to prepare for college. The program was to get hands on experience at a company before they went to school so they could decide a career path with more information on what the day to day is like in the workplace.

When I met this student, he informed me the program randomly placed the kids into jobs blindly. He had no idea what I did or what he was going to do. When I told him I am a data scientist, he was not happy and had no interest at all. He was hoping for a sales or marketing placement as that is more interesting to him.

The first week did not go well at all. He was very disinterested and vocal about it. So at the end of the week we did our required weekly progress report and I just begged him to give it a chance, because if he did poorly, we’re both going to look bad. 

Over the course of the 4 months he was with me, we spent afternoons completing complex problems, learning various programs, and making key business decisions using data driven decision making. I taught him SQL, R, Python, and power bi-automate. The kid was a natural. As a junior in high school he picked everything up faster than any university intern or junior I have ever trained. 

When our time was up. He thanked me for the opportunity and admitted while it was far from a career path he would choose, he learned a lot of valuable lessons and appreciated the experience. I attended his “graduation ceremony” from the program, we said our goodbyes, and parted ways. 


Here is where it gets just crazy. This morning, he sent me a long message on LinkedIn, wondering if I remembered him. And told me how inspiring our time was together. So much so that when he graduated this summer, he decided that he chose his college major (computer science & statistics) because of how gratifying the work we did was and how interested in data he became during our time. 

I’ll admit, I bawled like a baby. I was so honored to receive that message, and it was so gratifying for myself to be able to get through to someone like that.

You all need to think more like a company when working in a company.,"There's been a lot of complaining about stakeholders expectations on data scientists here lately.

This is not a good mindset and it's certainly not a good influence on those here new to the field.

&#x200B;

1. (almost) Every employer is in the business of making money. We are paid well because (presumably) what we do makes that goal happen more. It's that simple. But the work a data scientist does is not valuable if it does not end up either making more money enter the company, or making less money leave the company. If you are working on a project and you can not explain how it will result in one or both of those things happening (indirectly counts), you need to take a step back and figure that out.
2. If sales or leadership is asking you to give them simple explanations, it's not because they need you to explain your degree in three sentences. They are asking you to explain *which actual outcome becomes different when whatever you are building is added*, so that they can *help you sell your work to customers or downstream users,* and for you to indicate *what time and resources you need to make that happen*. Again, if you can not identify the action or decision which ends up different once your solution is in place, and describe how you optimize that outcome, you should be sceptical as to whether it is actually impactful.
3. When you are asked to outline deliverables, they are *letting you explain to them in what way you prefer to deliver your value added*. That is giving you the power. They are not asking you to do more work in a shorter time. They are asking you what will come out of your work, and what steps you (and they) will need to take to make that outcome happen. *Surely* the work you did two weeks ago (last sprint, if you will) is feeding into work you are doing now or at some point down the line. *The way it does so - is the deliverable of the work you did two weeks ago*. Even if that is a documented (positive or negative) outcome of an experiment. I refuse to believe that people with a master's degree or PhD in an engineering- or scientific field are not able to break their work down into steps if they put their mind to it.

Normalize writing good code,"The hardest part of ML is reading code written by other data scientists. Even code written by the highest level ML practitioners is atrocious. It is hard to learn new things from poorly written code. You either spend way too much time trying to follow their confusing logic, or you simply copy and paste and dont learn anything. It doesnt have to be this way!

Can we normalize coding good practices in data science?

Here are some suggestions:
1. Stop using long functions. Break complex logic into pieces.
2. Stop using massive one-liners to do complex data manipulation
3. Use type annotations and type hinting in function declarations
4. Use docstrings to describe what a function does, its inputs, and return values and types

I need to show how grateful I am to this sub,"Thanks you guys fpr every single book recommendation, for every single career advice.

I took your recommendations seriously, studied the books you told me to study, and studied other videos on my own, learning everything I can learn on my own.

Then I took the advice someone here told is to talk to someone internally in the data science team, turns out, they were impressed by the scope of the projects I worked on for a sales analyst and how I improved everything data-related in the department and the lead told me once I am ready (I still have a probability course to finish and recap hands on ML) and I will be up for a transfer.

I will be a junior DS in 5 or 6 months time after being an analyst for 2 years (I started when I was 20) and it's all you guys, so, thanks. 

Edit: here's everything:

I started when I was 18 years old, in something that I never knew it would be my gate to this job: a sales agent. Been so for a whole year. This gave me a lot of business context, how a manager leads people under him, and how his manager looks at his performance and understood something about the hierarchical behavior of companies. 
Then, I left the job after a year, now it's the pandemic, I spent it leqrning Excel and basic statistics, all on YouTube.

Moving forward to when I was 20, I had no idea a data analyst is even a title, and got a job as an accountant at a small workshop, with college going on, and I was studying business administration and statistics.
The job was never an accountant or have anything to do with accounting, my manager at the time was a very smart guy, working with pen and paper as his ledger, then I introduced Excel, he was all in for it, I started creating tables for our sales and inventory and customers and places we work in.

He started asking questions, you said last month we made 40K, how come we make 45 this month? I started digging into our data unknowingly doing analysis.

His brother was a regular visitor, I learned that he is the head of data at a big startup in our country, saw what I did, kept giving me tasks and I answer with Excel.

Then, he gave me a course that I highly recommend about Excel: power tools in Excel, you can find sources on YouTube for it a lot (power query, power pivot and data modeling). I started applying DAX, and here comes my first book [Dax Guide](https://www.google.com.eg/books/edition/_/dtr8oQEACAAJ?hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiQo4eZ8OKEAxUXgP0HHXfgDTIQ7_IDKAB6BAgPEAM).

Then I started my LinkedIn journey, showing Excel and powerBI dashboards and applying to jobs, in data analysis, really that's all you need, business context, some technical tools to help you dig into the data and answer questions.

Then, I started reading about data science, how statistics is important and how much I liked it in college, here goes the second book, [Naked Statistics](https://www.amazon.com/Naked-Statistics-Stripping-Dread-Data-ebook/dp/B007Q6XLF2).
Here I learned to think with stats a bit.

Then, I found that I lack implementation to a lot of concepts to statistics, people recommended python for me, here there were two sources for me to learn from, YouTube courses got me up and running into how to write simple code in python and understand the syntax.

Later, DataCamp had tracks, I finished the Data Analyst with python and another one data analyst with SQL. This helped me BIG time in knowing where to go next. 

Note: I was doing all of that while working and being in college.

The DataCamp course had great courses about statistics and probability and simulation. While also practicing SQL, I got really good with it.

Now, got a job as a junior sales ops analyst (my role now). I got lucky, working on real problems and practicing what I learn.

Then started moving back to books, but I lacked problem solving mindset, read these books: [Stop Guessing](https://www.amazon.com/Stop-Guessing-Behaviors-Problem-Solvers/dp/162656986X) and[Lean Analytics](https://leananalyticsbook.com/).

This helped me big time understand how my work affects the company. 

Now it's time to show your work to stakeholders, I read this book: [Storytelling with data](https://leananalyticsbook.com/).

It's time to go back to the details of my job, It was all querying on metabase, an open source BI tool.

I was responsible for giving agents retailers to visit, so, Every morning, we are supposed to apply filters on our data (last order date, last visit date and some other features ) and tell the agent, visit 20 of those retailers and go home. I was doing all of that in an automated fashion with power query, creating automated pipelines was my passion in Excel. All I had to do was give it an updated file from our database, refresh the pipeline, take the new file, dump it into our system.

They do visit 20 retailers, but the problem reached the tech team, the data was too much to handle, requiring us to give a smaller set of retailers for the agents, specifically 40 retailers.

But how do we guarantee they are close to each other? Here come my first interaction with adata scientist.

I did all what I did in Excel but in python using pandas and then reached the point where I don't know how to give clusters.

He took my jupyter notebook, gave it to us back with the solution to our problem, with something I was not familiar with at the time, Kmeans constrained.
Which took only longitude, latitude gave each agent his route of 40 retailers.

I started taking notes from his improvements to my code and asked him, what did you do?

He told my my code was fine, but you used a lot of custom functions on operations that can be vectorized, I asked for a book recommendation about vectorized operations in pandas here, the guys recommended this [Data Wrangling in python book](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Wrangling-Python-Tools-Easier/dp/1491948817).

After that book, I was obsessed with data automation in python using pandas and numpy only.

I got also obsessed with vectorizing any operation in our code base, read something pandas specific now: [Effective Pandas](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Pandas-Patterns-Manipulation-Treading/dp/B09MYXXSFM).

Then, it was the part where he interacted with our system API.

Since all our company data scientists and swes have access to snowflake and live databases, we, analysts, had access to only metabase.

I saw this as an opportunity to get known!

I wrote two functions used by our entire company, ret_metabase and interact_with_google_sheets
The first one connects to the API endpoint and then takes your credintials and the makes a session ID and gets your card ID string response in json and I convert it to a dataframe. The second requires an Api key, thenenables tge user to do anything with a google sheet, remove data set with a dataframe get data asa dataframe append on data filter views really anything in one function.
How did I learn to do all of that? A course on youtube , just type API development in python amd a book about data structures, [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Pandas-Patterns-Manipulation-Treading/dp/B09MYXXSFM). This helped big time in optimizing my code performance and writing cleaner code.

I got known and these functions are in the companies library now and people use it all the time. And I even left funny comments in the documentation and Everything.

The kmeans thing got me really interested in machine learning and here's the first book you guys recommended: [ISLR](https://www.statlearning.com/).

It was really hard for me at first because I had not been introduced properly to those three topics:
1- linear algebra
2- calculus
3- probability and statistics
I took [Jon Krohn's live lessions](https://github.com/jonkrohn/ML-foundations) it's free on YouTube.

But those three were later taken (started linear algebra in November 23).

So I struggled back then and here, another book was suggested: Hands-on ML.

I finished it and was really fucking hyped to apply the stuff I learned directly into my job, even without my manager permissions.

But that was not enough, I did not know what I should do to impact our compqny, what is data science?

I read this book: [Data science with business, what you need to know about DS](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Business-Data-Analytic-Thinking/dp/1449361323)

First thing I dod after understanding what kmeans is, improved our routes clustering function by standerdizing the scales of the long, lat, giving it another column ( retailer rank) that rankstarts at the maximum value the longitude and decays linearly from 31 to 30 (longitude here is from 30 to 31), I used linspace and select in numpy here to give retailers ranks. This rank was business objective (give 31 toretailers with high conversion and then 30.9 to retailers with monotonically decreasing nmv to make them order back and so on...) Any other retailer takes a zero in his face. This helped in giving optimized distance to retailers we really need to visit.

This gave us a big boost in agents strike rate and overall performance.

Second, I applied xgboost, predicting who will place an order today if visited. Gave them the biggest rank.

Testing this was a must, so I learned about A/B testing, and some other great bootstrapping ideas here [Practical Statistics](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-statistics-for/9781491952955/) Book.

This pushed our strike rate from 40 to 73%.

Then, I really now see that I lack probability knowledge and maths knowledge to be a data scientist, so I read [Essential maths for DS](https://www.amazon.eg/-/en/Essential-Math-Data-Science-Fundamental/dp/1098102932).

Since my job was about sales operations, it was a necessary thing to automate discovering new sales areas and opportunity, previously, we used to draw polygons in areas we want to open, and then the agents are set there to wander and find retailers on their own.

I got an idea, how about I get all streets know in this area and make blocks in the intersections and then convert the coords to google maps link and give 50 daily sequential links to agents to discover areas in a more naturally sequential way? I used omnix API to get streets data and geopandas to make all other operations, I learned how to work with geopandas from their docs, really straightforward.

This project was big, applied everything I know about pandas and data structures and business knowledge to do it, and it's up and running now.

I got praised for it and the head of data was impressed with the result and decided to give me access to snowflake directly to limit requests on metabase as the data was big and then I scaled the project to all regions we operate in.

Then it was time to speak with the senior ds lead.

I showed him all I wrote here, he recommended I get a strong foundation in linear algebra and calculus and probability.

I got it, and now working on probability and statistics.

I then told him I am really into causal inference (rwcommended by someone in my previous post here) and regression analysis.

He said that's exactly what they need from the junior they want to hire, ""anyone can fit and predict nowdays"" he said, ""we need someone who can make an impact in all the stuff we don't have time for and teach him more cloud tools and maybe he gives us new ideas or show us new tools"" he elaborated.

Right now I am studying probability and statistics and then will study [Causal Inference](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/causal-inference-in/9781098140243/).


I guess that's all, the most important thing is that you keep studying and never giving up, please, focus more on business context as it's overlooked.

PSA: You don't need fancy stuff to do good work.,"I've been reading a lot of posts on r/datascience and several seem to orbit the subject of how to use the latest tool or tweak, I understand that it can be easy to get caught up in the whirlwind of tools, frameworks, and cutting-edge technologies. While these advancements can undoubtedly enhance our work, it's important to remember that data science isn't about using the most advanced or expensive tools; it's about extracting valuable insights from data to drive informed decision-making.

Data Collection and Categorization

Before diving into advanced machine learning algorithms or statistical models, we need to start with the basics: collecting and organizing data. Fortunately, both Python and R offer a wealth of libraries that make it easy to collect data from a variety of sources, including web scraping, APIs, and reading from files. Key libraries in Python include [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [BeautifulSoup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), while R has [httr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html), [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/), and [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/).

These libraries not only make it easy to collect data but also to clean and structure it for analysis. With just a few lines of code, you can filter, sort, and transform data into a format that's ready for exploration and modeling.

Data Analysis and Visualization

Once your data is collected and organized, the next step is to analyze and visualize it. Both Python and R excel in this area, providing a wide range of libraries and packages for exploratory data analysis and visualization.

Python's pandas, [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), and [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) libraries offer powerful functionality for data manipulation, while [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), and [plotly](https://plotly.com/) provide versatile tools for creating visualizations. Similarly, in R, you can use dplyr, [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), and [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html) for data manipulation, and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [lattice](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lattice/index.html), and [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) for visualization. These packages enable you to create insightful visualizations and perform statistical analyses without relying on expensive or proprietary software.

Modeling and Prediction

Finally, when it comes to building models and making predictions, Python and R have a plethora of options available. Libraries like [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org), [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html), and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)in Python, or [caret](https://topepo.github.io/caret/), [randomForest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/randomForest.pdf), and [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)in R, provide powerful machine learning algorithms and statistical models that can be applied to a wide range of problems. What's more, these libraries are open-source and have extensive documentation and community support, making it easy to learn and apply new techniques without needing specialized training or expensive software licenses.

Simplicity is key, embrace it and you'll learn a lot faster than trying to glean insights from some poorly trained AI model.

Burned out after 3 days,"So I graduated University last month, and have had 3 different data scientist internships, and have just started a full time Data Scientist position at a scale-up company, where I am the second data scientist (the other data scientist is my manager) - and am 3 days into my job. 

I got hired with the company knowing I have zero experience with AWS, and I have no experience or domain knowledge industry of this industry (telecom industry). 

I’ve been tasked for my first project by the founder and the CTO of the company which is to understand how a ‘big and important’ client is losing so much money in Asia. And have been told numerous times how important the success of this project is for my company’s financial future and if the project isn’t successful we would lose this major client - and there is a strict deadline for 1 months time to complete this major project, which includes answering over 20 giant questions about the data, with many deliverables (it doesn’t help the quality of data is absolutely garbage). 

It’s only been 3 days and I feel so out of my depth. The founders and CTO are referring to this project as a ‘trial by fire’ and I am terrified. 

Sure the project is do-able, but I’m a fresh grad, junior data scientist and don’t feel like a project of this scale and importance should be given to a junior. Or maybe it should and I’m going crazy. 

My manager is great but has little time to support me. 

Not sure what to do or feel, but terrified and burnt out already by the thought of failing this project, losing the company tons of money and maybe getting fired as I’m on probation for the first 6 months of my job.

Data Science is a fad (Cynical Post #2334),"I wanted to contribute yet another post which is more on the cynical side regarding data science as an industry. I know that many people lurking here are trying to draw up pros and cons lists for going into the industry. This is a contribution to the cons column.

My current gripe with DS is that I have lost faith that the industry will ever be able to absorb data-driven decision making as a culture. For a long time, I thought that it's more about improving my communication skills, creating explainers on how the models work, or just waiting for the world to 'catch-up' to data science. These techniques were new and complex, after all - it would take some time for the industry to adjust, as a Gartner article might tell you. But those businesses which did adjust would do better over time, and the market would force others to compete.

This line of thinking completely falls apart once you go into the history of 'quantitative methods' in business decision making. DS is really just the latest in a long line of attempts at doing this stuff including:

* Quantitative Methods
* Operations Research
* Management Science (Rebranded Operations Research)
* Business Intelligence
* Data Mining
* Business Analytics

All these fields are still around, of course. But they tend to occupy a particular niche, and their claims to radically transform the business world are gone. They aren't the 'sexiest job of the 21 century"". People have been trying to do this whole ""Business, but with Models!"" thing for *years*. But it never really caught on. Why?

DS is just hype, and the hype cycle for DS will implode and not recover. Or it will recover to the same level that these other techniques did.

Data Science isn't better than any of those other disciplines. Here is my response to some objections:

* **Maybe they weren't adding real business value?** Crack open the average Operations Research / Management Science textbook and I guarantee you you'll find problems which are more business-focused than anything you'll find on Towards Data Science or a DS textbook. They developed remarkable models to deal with inventory problems, demand estimation, resource planning, scheduling problems, forecasting and insights gathering - and most of their models were even prescriptive and automated using Optimization solvers.
* **But they weren't putting their models in production right?** Yes, but the concept of doing a regression on a huge business data base, or even using a decision tree, is decades old now. It used to be called ""Knowledge Discovery in Databases"" and later ""Data Mining"". The ISLR of data mining, Witten's *Data Mining*, was first published in 2003. That's 20 years ago. They were using Java to do everything we do today, and at a reasonable scale (especially considering that with many of these problems, an extra GB of data doesn't get you much).
* **But they weren't doing predictive modelling.** TBH predictive modelling is one of the least impressive sub-branches of modelling, I have no idea why it's so hyped. Much more interesting and relevant models - optimization modelling, risk analysis, forecasting, clustering - have all fallen out of popularity. Why do you think predictive modelling is the secret bullet? Besides, they did have some predictive modelling - 'data mining' used to include it as a part of the study, together with other 'modern' techniques like anomaly detection, association rules/market basket analysis.
* **But what about \[insert specific application here\]**. Most of the things that people pitch as being 'things we can now do with data science' are decades old. For example, customer segmentation models using 'data science' to help you better understand customers... You can find marketing analytics textbooks from the late 90s that show you exactly how to do that. And they'll include a hell of a lot more domain knowledge than most data science articles today, which seem to think that the domain knowledge just needs an introductory paragraph to grok and then we get to the Python.
* **Maybe it just takes time?** Wayne Winston's *Operations Research* was published in 1987 and included material that could help you basically automate a significant amount of your business decision making with a PC. That was 36 years ago.
* **But what about big data?** The law of large numbers and the central limit theorem still apply. At a certain point, the extra gigabyte of data isn't really helping, and neither is the extra column in the database.
* **Data Science is much more complex and advanced, true data science requires a PhD**. An actual graduate level course in Operations Research requires you to integrate advanced linear algebra, computational algorithms and PhD level statistics to develop automated solutions that scale. People with these skills have been building enormous models for the airline industry for a few decades now, but were barely recognized for it. DS isn't that much more complex, so what justifies the large salaries and hype when com. sci + math + stats at scale has been around for a while now?

The marginal improvement in the performance of a subset of statistical techniques (predictive modelling, forecasting) doesn't justify the sudden exuberance about DS and 'data'.

As best I can tell, here is what is truly new in 'data science':

* ML means we can turn unstructured data like videos and images and text into structured data: e.g. easily estimating the amount of damage by a flood for an insurer using satellite images.
* People in Silicon Valley can have human-out-the-loop decision making, which they need for their apps and recommenders. This use case is truly new and didn't exist in the 90s.

I think that this kind of 'operational data science' makes sense: using truly new types of data from video to images, and having computers which we can trust to label the data and apply further logic to it. That's new.

But the kind of data science where you think that you submitting a report or visualisation to your boss and then he'll take it into consideration when he makes decisions - that's been around for ages. It's never become the kind of revolutionary, widespread force in business that DS keeps promising it will be. In ten years, ""data scientist"" will be like Operations Researcher - a very niche and special thing off in the corner somewhere which most people don't know about outside of a particular industry.

The only people who managed to really turn maths into money were the Actuarial Scientists and the Quants (Financial Engineers).

My take now is basically this:

* If you work in the actual niche where data science has something new to offer - processing unstructured data for use in live apps like Tinder - then yes, continue. That's great. That's the equivalent of doing Operations Research and going into logistics.
* If you are trying to apply those same techniques to general business decision making, then you are going to end up like a ""Management Scientist"" or, for that matter, a ""BI Analyst"" in a few years - they were once the cutting edge just like DS is now. They amounted to very little. There's really no difference. Predictive modelling is not so much more amazing than optimization or association rules, which nobody talks about much anymore.
* If you just want to make a lot of money doing maths - go for Actuarial Science or Financial Engineering/Quants. Those guys figured it out and then created a walled garden of credentials to protect their salaries. Just join them. (Although I hear Act Sci is more about regulations in practise than maths, but still).

tl;dr - DS is just the latest in a long string of equally 'revolutionary' and impressive attempts at introducing scientific decision making into business. It will become as marginalised as all of them in the future, outside of the Silicon Valley niche. Your boss, your company and your industry will never adopt a true data-driven culture - they've had almost 40 years to do it by now and they're still suspicious of regression beyond the 'line of best fit'. It's not happening fam.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/14khdp2/data_science_is_a_fad_cynical_post_2334/

Pre screening assessments are getting insane,"I am a data scientist in industry. I applied for a job of data scientist. 

I heard back regarding an assessment which is a word document from an executive assistant. The task is to automate anaysis for bullet masking cartilages. They ask to build an algorithm and share the package to them.

No data was provided, just 1 image as an example with little  explanation . They expect a full on model/solution to be developed in 2 weeks. 

Since when is this bullshit real, how is a data scientist expected to get the bullet cartilages of a 9mm handgun with processing and build an algorithm and deploy it in a package in the span of two weeks for a Job PRE-SCREENING.

Never in my life saw any pre screening this tough. This is a flat out project to do on the job.


Edit: i saw a lot of the comments from the people in the community. Thank you so much for sharing your stories. I am glad that I am not the only one that feels this way. 

Update: the company expects candidates to find google images for them mind it, do the forensic analysis and then train a model for them. Everything is to be handed to them as a package. Its even more grunt work where people basically collect data for them and build models. 

Update2: the hiring manager responds with saying this is a very basic straightforward task. Thats what the job does on a daily basis and is one of the easiest things a data scientist can do. Despite the overwhelming complexity and how tedious it is to manually do the thing.

3. There are lots of moving parts to getting a job. Since I do not know what you are doing wrong or right, I can't provide any new tips/tricks that you probably haven't seen reels/videos/articles of.
4. Scoring an interview has a different skillset from cracking the interview. The former is mostly non-technical, the latter being extremely technical.
5. If you have anything specific area I can assist with, I am more than happy to help if I can.
6. Again, I must request you to not ask me for guidance without being specific - I do not know what you are doing wrong or right, so me repeating the same advice won't work. For e.g. a specific question might be  - ""*Is DSA necessary to learn*?"" Then no, I have neither studied DSA nor have been asked in any of my 30+ interviews I have given. However, it's not a thumb rule that you might not be asked.

Where are all the entry level jobs? Which MS program should I go for? Some tips from a hiring manager at an F50,"The bulk of this subreddit is filled with people trying to break into data science, completing certifications and getting MS degrees from diploma mills but with no real guidance. Oftentimes the advice I see here is from people without DS jobs trying to help other people without DS jobs on projects etc. It's more or less blind leading the blind.

Here's an insider perspective from me. I'm a hiring manager at an F50 financial services company you've probably heard of, I've been working for \~4 years and I'll share how entry-level roles actually get hired into.

There's a few different pathways. I've listed them in order of where the bulk of our candidate pool and current hires comes from

1. We pick MS students from very specific programs that we trust. These programs have been around for a while, we have a relationship with the school and have a good idea of the curriculum. Georgia Tech, Columbia, UVa, UC Berkeley, UW Seattle, NCSU are some universities we hire from. We don't come back every year to hire, just the years that we need positions filled. Sometimes you'll look around at teams here and 40% of them went to the same program. They're stellar hires. The programs that we hire from are incredibly competitive to get into, are not diploma mills, and most importantly, their programs have been around longer than the DS hype. How does the hiring process work? We just reach out to the career counselor at the school, they put out an interest list for students who want to work for us, we flip through the resumes and pick the students we like to interview. It's very streamlined both for us as an employer and for the student. Although I didn't come from this path (I was a referred by a friend during the hiring boom and just have a PhD), I'm actively involved in the hiring efforts.
2. We host hackathons every year for students to participate in. The winners of these hackathons typically get brought back to interview for internship positions, and if they perform well we pick them up as full time hires.
3. Generic career fairs at universities. If you go a to a university, you've probably seen career fairs with companies that come to recruit.
4. Referrals from our current employees. Typically they refer a candidate to us, we interview them, and if we like them, we'll punt them over to the recruiter to get the process started for hiring them. Typically the hiring manager has seen the resume before the recruiter has because the resume came straight to their inbox from one of their colleagues
5. Internal mobility of someone who shows promise but just needs an opportunity. We've already worked with them in some capacity, know them to be bright, and are willing to give them a shot even if they don't have the skills.
6. Far and away the worst and hardest way to get a job, our recruiter sends us their resume after screening candidates who applied online through the job portal. Our recruiters know more or less what to look for (I'm thankful ours are not trash)

This is true not just for our company but a lot of large companies broadly. I know Home Depot, Microsoft and few other large retail companies some of my network works at hire candidates this way.

Is it fair to the general population? No. But as employees at a company we have limited resources to put into finding quality candidates and we typically use pathways that we know work, and work well in generating high quality hires.

EDIT: Some actionable advice for those who are feeling disheartened. I'll add just a couple of points here:

1. If you already have your MS in this field or a related one and are looking for a job, reach out to your network. Go to the career fairs at your university and see if you can get some data-adjacent job in finance, marketing, operations or sales where you might be working with data scientists. Then you can try to transition internally into the roles that might be interesting to you.
2. There are also non-profit data organizations like Data Kind and others. They have working data scientists already volunteering time there, you can get involved, get some real world experience with non-profit data sets and leverage that to set yourself apart. It's a fantastic way to get some experience AND build your professional network.
3. Work on an open-source library and making it better. You'll learn some best practices. If you make it through the online hiring screen, this will really set you apart from other candidates
4. If you are pre MS and just figuring out where you want to go, research the program's career outcomes before picking a school. No school can guarantee you a job, but many have strong alumni and industry networks that make finding a job way easier. Do not go just because it looks like it's easy to get into. If it's easy to get into, it means that they're a new program who came in with the hype train

EDIT 2: I think some people are getting the wrong idea about ""prestige"" where the companies I'm aware of only hire from Ivies or public universities that are as strong as Ivies. That's not always the case - some schools have deliberately cultivated relationships with employers to generate a talent pipeline for their students. They're not always a top 10 school, but programs with very strong industry connections.

For example, Penn State is an example of a school with very strong industry ties to companies in NJ, PA and NY for engineering students. These students can go to job fairs or sign up for company interest lists for their degree program at their schools, talk directly to working alumni and recruiters and get their resume in front of a hiring manager that way. It's about the relationship that the university has cultivated to the local industries that hire and their ability to generate candidates that can feed that talent pipeline.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/17avmi5/where_are_all_the_entry_level_jobs_which_ms/

I feel like a fraud,"Hello,

I'm a so-called data scientist with 4 YoE and an academic background in maths (pretty much nothing in software engineering).

My first job out of college was in a small ""data team"" (I was the only DS, there were 2 others guys, mostly seniors and sort of a mix of Data Engineer/Devops/Software Engineer). Our team mission was to bring value to the company using data.

Job was pretty chill, tbh I haven't been doing much over the 4 years. Mostly failed POC on jupyter and a lot of non-DS-related stuff (like dashboarding type of stuff).

However, there was one initiative I took that resulted in something that was deemed valuable enough to be pushed into production. It was a mix of NLP/timeseries project which actually gave some very interesting results, although if I'm being honest, it is definitely not worth the 4 years of salary they paid me.

As I was asked to industrialize the solution, I had some help from my other 2 senior colleagues who introduced me to linux, git, docker/kubernetes, flask, airflow, and some good coding practices such as linting, testing, hinting, logging, classes and decorators on Python.

The thing is, they never reviewed my work nor made sure I was following all the recommended guidelines, and as I was overwhelmed by all those new concepts, I ended up just not following them, or not correctly at least.

Like sure, I'll use git to track my code. Guess what, I never work with branching and just commited everything on the same master branch.

Classes and decorators ? No that's too complex and abstract, let's just do it plain and simple.

Testing and hinting ? Maybe later.

Couple of times I have tried to motivate myself to learn all of this properly on my own, but although I have learned some stuff this and there, I have never reached that stage where I feel comfortable using all this, and always felt unmotivated afterwards by how vast those subjects are and how little I knew.

&#x200B;

3 months ago, my manager who used to be a technical guy but has been doing managing for quite some time now, and who for some reason always thought I was someone brilliant and creative out of the bunch (he led 3 other teams with a total of \~20 people) was hired by a mid-size company to become their head of data. He offered me a position here as a senior data scientist which I took. He then hired a couple of other data scientists (they introduced themselves as MLE rather than DS) with about 2 YoE.

Those guys are so good they are making me feel like a fraud. They are using git as if they invented the tool. The way they structured their code, using mostly classes and decorators everywhere just baffles me. They seem to have no trouble with devops concept (like CI/CD), API management, networks etc ... while I'm here struggling with the proxy of my VM just to reach the internet.

I've recently discovered the joy of reviewing PR on github and boy it is exhausting to follow what they do. I basically have to google everything as they are using stuff I didn't even knew existed. It probably took me 10 hours to review a bunch of code they wrote in probably one hour.

I am sure by now they see me as a fraud, and they seem to be both the kind of judging type (3 weeks in and they already had some heated arguments on software engineering). I think so far I was protected by my ""senior"" title and the fact that I have known our manager for quite some time now, but I'm expecting that this masquerade will not hold for long.

&#x200B;

I'm lost, IDK what to do. Is there a way for me to catch up everything in a short amount of time ? I understand that a regular data scientist with ""expertise"" in ML is no longer bankable and people now are turning towards ""full-stack"" MLE with a software engineering background, who are able to manage the entire pipeline and  produce professional code that is robust, readable and maintanable.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/14fgpm7/i_feel_like_a_fraud/

RANT - There's a cheating problem in Data Science Interviews,"I work at a large company, and we receive quite a lot of applicants. Most of our applicants have 6-9 years of experience in roles titled as Data Analytics/Data Science/Data Engineering across notable companies and brands like Walmart, Ford, Accenture, Amazon, Ulta, Macy's, Nike, etc.

The nature of our interviews is fairly simple - we have a brief phone call on theory and foundation of data analytics, and then have a couple of technical interviews focusing on programming and basic data analysis. The interview doesn't cover anything out of the ordinary for most analysts (not even data scientists), and focuses on basic data analysis practices (filter down a column given a set of requirements, get a count of uniques, do basic EDA and explain how to manage outliers). 

All interviewees are told they can use Google as we don't expect people to memorize the syntax, but we do expect them to have at least working knowledge of the tools we expect them to use. The interviews are all remote and don't require in-person meeting. The interviews are basically screen share of Google Colab where we run basic analysis.

In our recent hiring spree, out of the 7 potential candidates we interviewed, we caught 4 of them cheating.

Given their profile, I'm a bit amazed that they resorted to cheating. Whether it was by having someone else on the call helping them answer the question, or having someone entirely different answer their questions, and other notable methods that I don't want to share that we caught while they were sharing their screens. I've learned from my colleagues that there are actual *agencies* in India and China who offer interview 'assistance' services.

At this stage, our leadership is planning to require all potential candidates to be local - this eliminates remote option. On the same token, those cheaters passing the recruiter screening are quite frankly just making it worse for people who are actually capable. Questions become more theoretical and quite specific to industry, scope of hiring will be limited to people within specific domains, and improptu coding tests will be given out without heads up to hinder people from cheating and setting up whatever they do to cheat.

How do you convince the management that they don't need ML when a simple IF-ELSE logic would work?,"So my org has hired a couple of data scientists recently. We've been inviting them regularly to our project meetings. It has been only a couple of weeks into the meetings and they have already started proposing ideas to the management about how the team should be using ML, DL and even LLMs. 

The management, clearly influenced by these fanc & fad terms, is now looking down upon my team for not having thought about these ideas before, and wants us to redesign a simple IF-ELSE business logic using ML.

It seems futile to workout an RoI calculation for this new initiative and present it to the management when they are hell-bent on having that sweet  AI tag in their list of accomplishments. Doing so would also show my team in bad light for resisting change and not being collaborative enough with the new guys.

But it is interesting how some new-age data scientists prematurely propose solutions, without even understanding the business problem and the tradeoffs. It is not the first time I am seeing this perennial itch to disrupt among newer professionals, even outside of data science. I've seen some very naive explanations given by these new data scientists, such as, ""Oh, its a standard algorithm. It just needs more data. It will get better over time."" Well, it does not get better. And it is my team that needs to do the clean up after all this POC mess. Why can't they spend time understanding what the business requirements are and if you really need to bring the big guns to a stick fight?

I'm not saying there aren't any ML problems that need solving in my org, but this one is not a problem that needs ML. It is just not worth the effort and resources. My current data science team is quite mature in business understanding and dissecting the problem to its bone before coming up with an analytical solution, either ML or otherwise; but now it is under pressure to spit out predictive models whose outputs are as good as flukes in production, only because management wants to ride the AI ML bandwagon.

Edit: They do not directly report to me, the VP level has interviewed them and hired them under their tutelage to make them data-smart. And since they give proposals to the VPs and SVPs directly, it is often they jumping down our throats to experiment and execute.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/15vbkkn/how_do_you_convince_the_management_that_they_dont/
"UPDATE #2: I built an app to make my job search a little more sane, and I thought others might like it too! No ads, no recruiter spam, etc.","Hey again everyone!

&#x200B;

We've made a lot of progress on [zen](https://zensearch.jobs/) in the past few months, so I'll drop a couple of the most important things / highlights about the app here:

* Zen is still a candidate / seeker-first job board. This means we have no ads, we have no promoted jobs from companies who are paying us, we have no recruiters, etc. The whole point of Zen is to help you find jobs quickly at companies you're interested in without any headaches.
* On that point, we'll send you emails notifying you when companies you care about post new jobs that match your preferences, so you don't need to continuously check their job boards.

&#x200B;

In the past few months, we've made some major changes! Many of them are [discussed in the changelog](https://zensearch.jobs/changelog):

1. [We now have a much more feature-complete way of matching you to relevant jobs](https://zensearch.jobs/jobs)
2. We've collected a ton of new jobs and companies, so we now have \~2,700 companies in our database and almost 100k open jobs!
3. We've overhauled the UX to make it less noisy and easier for you to find jobs you care about.
4. We also added [a feedback page](https://zensearch.jobs/feedback) to let you submit feedback about the app to us!

&#x200B;

I started building Zen when I was on the job hunt and realized it was harder than it should've been to just get notifications when a company I was interested in posted a job that was relevant to me. And we hope that this goal -- to cut out all the noise and make it easier for you to find great matches -- is valuable for everyone here :)

Edit: I am amazed by the amount of comments, I read through every single of them and it is unanimous: chatgpt is a valuable tool for our work, as someone said, should I feel embarrassed to use a tool to be better on my work and learn new concepts?

Manager with no data science background wants to bring in people from his team and is asking us to train them end to end to replace existing people,"Edit1: Thank you all for the comments. I saw some really good advice that I am going to think about and share with my colleagues. To the comments suggesting ""to just leave"" - The company culture, projects and team is a dream. I have not seen more than 2-3 people leave in last 5-6 years I have been here. I am not planning a move anytime soon since I love the work and overall culture. However, I need a productive way to deal with situation.

Some other clarification - we are not being asked to train ""data analyst"" I would rather prefer that. We are being asked to train people who don't code and use an automated software to pick and dump data.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Old manager (data scientist) left and now a manager from data management is managing our team. He doesn't understand the project process or requirements. He trying to change a lot of things and one thing he is consistently focusing on is our salaries. He has repeatedly made comments that ""this"" (data science and analytics) team is paid more than other teams and he doesn't see why that's the case. In one one-on-one meeting he mentioned that there are many people on a certain level and company would not be able to support promoting everyone at these salaries hence we need to think about how to replace them once these people quit due to no promotions. We haven't had much luck while trying to hire external people (lack of good candidates). He insisted that we need to hire and train juniors from his team on data science process so that they can catch up and deliver when the time comes. His older team (data management) team works on selecting and filtering data, they have no experience or business understanding of the process. I resisted and mentioned that it's hard enough to find someone with basic knowledge and up-skill them to level they can deliver projects. It would be a very long and frustrating process to train people who have no background in statistics. Also, it would easily take 1-2 years before they can independently take charge to execute things and we should hire at a position if the person doesn't at-least has some basic knowledge or some hands on projects. I also proposed bootcamps/professional trainings. But he was insisting on personal training from current employees.

How to deal with this? He is expecting us to train people one on one so they can potentially replace us? He is one of the person who oversees the appraisals however there is a person above him managing the department as well, we don't have direct connects with this person so no idea what he know what he doesn't.

I tried to tell them many times we have to get data from soon-to-be customers because our tests are just approximation with synthetic data and aren't reliable. Unfortunately no one is getting some and for now all I do is creating new datasets (synthetic ofc) by guessing what our customers data will look like and use them for experiments that are a waste of time because once again they do not reflect real life results but the synthetic results. For now even all experiments are just the same experiment on new dataset because they want to see changes in results and comparision. I have a pretty good feeling that once we get the real life data we will understand everything was a waste of time but management wants me to keep pursuing this approach.

Scikit-learn Visualization Guide: Making Models Speak,"Use the Display API to replace complex Matplotlib code 

[ Scikit-learn Visualization Guide: Making Models Speak. ](https://preview.redd.it/pimy1i38a1qc1.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=f31492e48a5d39171c60d8e96ee8698c670327e7)

# Introduction

 In the journey of machine learning, explaining models with visualization is as important as training them. 

 A good chart can show us what a model is doing in an easy-to-understand way. Here's an example: 

[ Decision boundaries of two different generalization performances. ](https://preview.redd.it/3rrwu8rfa1qc1.png?width=863&format=png&auto=webp&s=9425bbe57deb98a854a40fdc0979149637078047)

 This graph makes it clear that for the same dataset, the model on the right is better at generalizing. 

 Most machine learning books prefer to use raw Matplotlib code for visualization, which leads to issues: 

1. You have to learn a lot about drawing with Matplotlib.
2. Plotting code fills up your notebook, making it hard to read.
3. Sometimes you need third-party libraries, which isn't ideal in business settings.

 Good news! Scikit-learn now offers Display classes that let us use methods like from\_estimator and from\_predictions to make drawing graphs for different situations much easier. 

 Curious? Let me show you these cool APIs. 

 

# Scikit-learn Display API Introduction

### Use utils.discovery.all_displays to find available APIs

 Scikit-learn (sklearn) always adds Display APIs in new releases, so it's key to know what's available in your version. 

 Sklearn's [utils.discovery.all\_displays](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.utils.discovery.all_displays.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.utils.discovery.all_displays) lets you see which classes you can use. 

    from sklearn.utils.discovery import all_displays
    
    displays = all_displays()
    displays

 For example, in my Scikit-learn 1.4.0, these classes are available: 

    [('CalibrationDisplay', sklearn.calibration.CalibrationDisplay),
     ('ConfusionMatrixDisplay',
      sklearn.metrics._plot.confusion_matrix.ConfusionMatrixDisplay),
     ('DecisionBoundaryDisplay',
      sklearn.inspection._plot.decision_boundary.DecisionBoundaryDisplay),
     ('DetCurveDisplay', sklearn.metrics._plot.det_curve.DetCurveDisplay),
     ('LearningCurveDisplay', sklearn.model_selection._plot.LearningCurveDisplay),
     ('PartialDependenceDisplay',
      sklearn.inspection._plot.partial_dependence.PartialDependenceDisplay),
     ('PrecisionRecallDisplay',
      sklearn.metrics._plot.precision_recall_curve.PrecisionRecallDisplay),
     ('PredictionErrorDisplay',
      sklearn.metrics._plot.regression.PredictionErrorDisplay),
     ('RocCurveDisplay', sklearn.metrics._plot.roc_curve.RocCurveDisplay),
     ('ValidationCurveDisplay',
      sklearn.model_selection._plot.ValidationCurveDisplay)]

### Using inspection.DecisionBoundaryDisplay for decision boundaries

 Since we mentioned it, let's start with decision boundaries. 

 If you use Matplotlib to draw them, it's a hassle: 

* Use np.linspace to set coordinate ranges;
* Use plt.meshgrid to calculate the grid;
* Use plt.contourf to draw the decision boundary fill;
* Then use plt.scatter to plot data points.

 Now, with  [inspection.DecisionBoundaryDispla](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.inspection.DecisionBoundaryDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn-inspection-decisionboundarydisplay), you can simplify this process: 

    from sklearn.inspection import DecisionBoundaryDisplay
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.svm import SVC
    from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    iris = load_iris(as_frame=True)
    X = iris.data[['petal length (cm)', 'petal width (cm)']]
    y = iris.target
    
    
    svc_clf = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), 
                            SVC(kernel='linear', C=1))
    svc_clf.fit(X, y)
    
    display = DecisionBoundaryDisplay.from_estimator(svc_clf, X, 
                                                     grid_resolution=1000,
                                                     xlabel=""Petal length (cm)"",
                                                     ylabel=""Petal width (cm)"")
    plt.scatter(X.iloc[:, 0], X.iloc[:, 1], c=y, edgecolors='w')
    plt.title(""Decision Boundary"")
    plt.show()

 See the final effect in the figure:

 Remember, Display can only draw 2D, so make sure your data has only two features or reduced dimensions. 

### Using calibration.CalibrationDisplay for probability calibration

 To compare classification models, probability calibration curves show how confident models are in their predictions. 

 Note that  [CalibrationDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.calibration.CalibrationDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.calibration.CalibrationDisplay) uses the model's  predict\_proba. If you use a support vector machine, set probability to True: 

    from sklearn.calibration import CalibrationDisplay
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    from sklearn.ensemble import HistGradientBoostingClassifier
    
    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000,
                               n_classes=2, n_features=5,
                               random_state=42)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, 
                                                        test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
    proba_clf = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), 
                              SVC(kernel=""rbf"", gamma=""auto"", 
                                  C=10, probability=True))
    proba_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    CalibrationDisplay.from_estimator(proba_clf, 
                                                X_test, y_test)
    
    hist_clf = HistGradientBoostingClassifier()
    hist_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    ax = plt.gca()
    CalibrationDisplay.from_estimator(hist_clf,
                                      X_test, y_test,
                                      ax=ax)
    plt.show()

### Using metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay for confusion matrices

 When assessing classification models and dealing with imbalanced data, we look at precision and recall. 

 These break down into TP, FP, TN, and FN – a confusion matrix. 

 To draw one, use  [metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn-metrics-confusionmatrixdisplay). It's well-known, so I'll skip the details. 

    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay
    
    digits = fetch_openml('mnist_784', version=1)
    X, y = digits.data, digits.target
    rf_clf = RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=5, random_state=42)
    rf_clf.fit(X, y)
    
    ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_estimator(rf_clf, X, y)
    plt.show()

[ Charts drawn with ConfusionMatrixDisplay. ](https://preview.redd.it/tfbcdin8f1qc1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1eaaf8e085e1cff8bb9c4bd971dade508010390)

### metrics.RocCurveDisplay and metrics.DetCurveDisplay

 These two are together because they're often used to evaluate side by side. 

 [RocCurveDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.RocCurveDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.metrics.RocCurveDisplay) compares TPR and FPR for the model. 

 For binary classification, you want low FPR and high TPR, so the upper left corner is best. The Roc curve bends towards this corner. 

 Because the Roc curve stays near the upper left, leaving the lower right empty, it's hard to see model differences. 

 So, we also use [DetCurveDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.DetCurveDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.metrics.DetCurveDisplay) to draw a Det curve with FNR and FPR. It uses more space, making it clearer than the Roc curve. 

 The perfect point for a Det curve is the lower left corner. 

    from sklearn.metrics import RocCurveDisplay
    from sklearn.metrics import DetCurveDisplay
    
    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=10_000, n_features=5,
                               n_classes=2, n_informative=2)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, 
                                                        test_size=0.3, random_state=42,
                                                        stratify=y)
    
    
    classifiers = {
        ""SVC"": make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SVC(kernel=""linear"", C=0.1, random_state=42)),
        ""Random Forest"": RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=5, random_state=42)
    }
    
    fig, [ax_roc, ax_det] = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 4))
    for name, clf in classifiers.items():
        clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
        
        RocCurveDisplay.from_estimator(clf, X_test, y_test, ax=ax_roc, name=name)
        DetCurveDisplay.from_estimator(clf, X_test, y_test, ax=ax_det, name=name)

[ Comparison Chart of RocCurveDisplay and DetCurveDisplay. ](https://preview.redd.it/odavl54yh1qc1.png?width=884&format=png&auto=webp&s=6408e319b099ce12c3eff70e788ed0224558e099)

### Using metrics.PrecisionRecallDisplay to adjust thresholds

 With imbalanced data, you might want to shift recall and precision. 

* For email fraud, you want high precision.
* For disease screening, you want high recall to catch more cases.

 You can adjust the threshold, but what's the right amount? 

 Here, [metrics.PrecisionRecallDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.PrecisionRecallDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn-metrics-precisionrecalldisplay) can help. 

    from xgboost import XGBClassifier
    from sklearn.datasets import load_wine
    from sklearn.metrics import PrecisionRecallDisplay
    
    wine = load_wine()
    X, y = wine.data[wine.target<=1], wine.target[wine.target<=1]
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3,
                                                        stratify=y, random_state=42)
    
    xgb_clf = XGBClassifier()
    xgb_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    PrecisionRecallDisplay.from_estimator(xgb_clf, X_test, y_test)
    plt.show()

[ Charting xgboost model evaluation using PrecisionRecallDisplay.  ](https://preview.redd.it/8giy5tr8i1qc1.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=06b96373c182f515a655d6f4029f44982c87b05d)

 This shows that models following Scikit-learn's design can be drawn, like xgboost here. Handy, right? 

### Using metrics.PredictionErrorDisplay for regression models

 We've talked about classification, now let's talk about regression. 

 Scikit-learn's [metrics.PredictionErrorDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.PredictionErrorDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn-metrics-predictionerrordisplay) helps assess regression models. 

    from sklearn.svm import SVR
    from sklearn.metrics import PredictionErrorDisplay
    
    rng = np.random.default_rng(42)
    X = rng.random(size=(200, 2)) * 10
    y = X[:, 0]**2 + 5 * X[:, 1] + 10 + rng.normal(loc=0.0, scale=0.1, size=(200,))
    
    reg = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SVR(kernel='linear', C=10))
    reg.fit(X, y)
    
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(8, 4))
    PredictionErrorDisplay.from_estimator(reg, X, y, ax=axes[0], kind=""actual_vs_predicted"")
    PredictionErrorDisplay.from_estimator(reg, X, y, ax=axes[1], kind=""residual_vs_predicted"")
    plt.show()

[Two charts were drawn by PredictionErrorDisplay.](https://preview.redd.it/9uxuobuti1qc1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=7db276b2a7d637cf53887e4cebe87b9a23593b9b)

 As shown, it can draw two kinds of graphs. The left shows predicted vs. actual values – good for linear regression. 

 However, not all data is perfectly linear. For that, use the right graph. 

 It compares real vs. predicted differences, a residuals plot. 

 This plot's banana shape suggests our data might not fit linear regression. 

 Switching from a linear to an rbf kernel can help. 

    reg = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SVR(kernel='rbf', C=10))

[ A visual demonstration of the improved model performance.  ](https://preview.redd.it/fsu1yqg0j1qc1.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=860447d0c8a1c0c38539f5fac16998ed928c8714)

 See, with rbf, the residual plot looks better. 

### Using model_selection.LearningCurveDisplay for learning curves

 After assessing performance, let's look at optimization with [LearningCurveDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.LearningCurveDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.model_selection.LearningCurveDisplay).

  First up, learning curves – how well the model generalizes with different training and testing data, and if it suffers from variance or bias. 

 As shown below, we compare a DecisionTreeClassifier and a GradientBoostingClassifier to see how they do as training data changes. 

    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
    from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
    from sklearn.model_selection import LearningCurveDisplay
    
    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_classes=2, n_features=10,
                               n_informative=2, n_redundant=0, n_repeated=0)
    
    tree_clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3, random_state=42)
    gb_clf = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=50, max_depth=3, tol=1e-3)
    
    train_sizes = np.linspace(0.4, 1.0, 10)
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 4))
    LearningCurveDisplay.from_estimator(tree_clf, X, y,
                                        train_sizes=train_sizes,
                                        ax=axes[0],
                                        scoring='accuracy')
    axes[0].set_title('DecisionTreeClassifier')
    LearningCurveDisplay.from_estimator(gb_clf, X, y,
                                        train_sizes=train_sizes,
                                        ax=axes[1],
                                        scoring='accuracy')
    axes[1].set_title('GradientBoostingClassifier')
    plt.show()

[ Comparison of the learning curve of two different models. ](https://preview.redd.it/2ljyfl9aj1qc1.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d7af8bd8a4295c54f6f5c3ce41caf2fd2ddb0c1)

 The graph shows that although the tree-based GradientBoostingClassifier maintains good accuracy on the training data, its generalization capability on test data does not have a significant advantage over the DecisionTreeClassifier. 

### Using model_selection.ValidationCurveDisplay for visualizing parameter tuning

 So, for models that don't generalize well, you might try adjusting the model's regularization parameters to tweak its performance. 

 The traditional approach is to use tools like GridSearchCV or Optuna to tune the model, but these methods only give you the overall best-performing model and the tuning process is not very intuitive. 

 For scenarios where you want to adjust a specific parameter to test its effect on the model, I recommend using [model\_selection.ValidationCurveDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.ValidationCurveDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.model_selection.ValidationCurveDisplay) to visualize how the model performs as the parameter changes. 

    from sklearn.model_selection import ValidationCurveDisplay
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    
    param_name, param_range = ""C"", np.logspace(-8, 3, 10)
    lr_clf = LogisticRegression()
    
    ValidationCurveDisplay.from_estimator(lr_clf, X, y,
                                          param_name=param_name,
                                          param_range=param_range,
                                          scoring='f1_weighted',
                                          cv=5, n_jobs=-1)
    plt.show()

[ Fine-tuning of model parameters plotted with ValidationCurveDisplay. ](https://preview.redd.it/5dcgo35jj1qc1.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed3d587e59d31902951ba0c9869ccd2bc39476d4)

# Some regrets

 After trying out all these Displays, I must admit some regrets: 

 

* The biggest one is that most of these APIs lack detailed tutorials, which is probably why they're not well-known compared to Scikit-learn's thorough documentation.
* These APIs are scattered across various packages, making it hard to reference them from a single place.
* The code is still pretty basic. You often need to pair it with Matplotlib's APIs to get the job done. A typical example is DecisionBoundaryDisplay  
, where after plotting the decision boundary, you still need Matplotlib to plot the data distribution.
* They're hard to extend. Besides a few methods validating parameters, it's tough to simplify my model visualization process with tools or methods; I end up rewriting a lot.

 I hope these APIs get more attention, and as versions upgrade, visualization APIs become even easier to use. 

 

# Conclusion

 In the journey of machine learning, explaining models with visualization is as important as training them. 

 This article introduced various plotting APIs in the current version of scikit-learn. 

 With these APIs, you can simplify some Matplotlib code, ease your learning curve, and streamline your model evaluation process. 

 Due to length, I didn't expand on each API. If interested, you can check the [official documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/visualizations.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com) for more details.

Just got my first Data Analyst job!,"I graduated from undergrad last year and went straight into being a clinical data manager.

How do you remember everything (theory/code) as a data scientist?,"I’m currently working as a Data Analyst/Scientist. It’s my first proper job since I completed my undergrad, and then PhD in Physics. 

I have a solid grasp of advanced mathematics, but I’ve never had any “formal” statistics training. I’m also a competent programmer, but I’m certainly not at the computer science or software developer level. I can write R or Python code which gets the job done but it isn’t always pretty, and will often google for solutions. Because of this, I’m sort of having to pick up things as I go along, which is okay but seems a bit overwhelming at times. 

I’m completely comfortable with exploratory data analysis, descriptive statistics etc. However, in my role, I often spend a few weeks at a time working on different projects. Sometimes I’ll work with inferential stats (e.g. using chi squared), and permutation testing. Then I’ll be doing predictive modelling and use something like logistic regression. 

Each time, I understand how these techniques work in terms of the mathematics, but by the time I come to look at them again, I’ve forgotten at least some of it. This especially applies to whenever I’ve tried to teach myself something like Bayesian stats/probability, or any time I read about things like neural networks, PCA, K-means, NLP techniques, as I don’t really use these in my role.

I wouldn’t say I’m a particularly forgetful person, it’s simply that I can’t remember all of these different statistical approaches and techniques in any great detail. Do I need know all of these well to be a good data scientist, or is it typical to end up “specialising” in one or two areas (E.g. predictive modelling, forecasting), depending on where you work?

On a side note - do I need to have a solid personal profile (E.g. GitHub projects) to do well in my career, or once I’ve got experience is that less relevant? I say that because outside of work, I prefer relaxing and doing other things that I enjoy - I really value work-life balance, and don’t necessarily care about making a ridiculous amount of money as long as I’m decently well paid.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/146ofs6/how_do_you_remember_everything_theorycode_as_a/

A website for you to learn NLP,"Hi all,

I made a website that details NLP from beginning to end. It covers a lot of the foundational methods including primers on the usual stuff (LA, calc, etc.) all the way ""up to"" stuff like Transformers.

I know there's tons of resources already out there and you probably will get better explanations from YouTube videos and stuff but you could use this website as kind of a reference or maybe you could use it to clear something up that is confusing. I made it mostly for myself initially and some of the explanations later on are more my stream of consciousness than anything else but I figured I'd share anyway in case it is helpful for anyone. At worst, it at least is like an ordered walkthrough of NLP stuff

I'm sure there's tons of typos or just some things I wrote that I misunderstood so any comments or corrects are welcome, you can feel free to message me and I'll make the changes.

It's mostly just meant as a public resource and I'm not getting anything from this (don't mean for this to come across as self-promotion or anything) but yeah, have a look!

Praised for building good models yesterday but got fired today.,"I'll not go into the details of the ML models I built. Here's the short story. 

I trained and built two models for two different tasks, got good results, beat the current benchmarks at my company (a startup), got good reviews by the CEO and the CTO (both of them are the co-founders of this company). Today morning, I got a phone call from one of them who told me my efforts aren't contributing anything to the company and I got fired. In my opinion, the company is out of funds. 

While I understand being fired, but I feel I've been stabbed in the back. It surely doesn't feel good. I have two questions 
1. Has anyone faced this in their career? 
2. How should I get my life back on track? I have a wife and a two year old daughter. I'm in India. Given the economy is bad, how can I maximize my chances of getting another job?

I have never had a manager in my entire career that provided any value to me,"In my entire career, I have never had a single manager that provided any value to me personally. Here's a recap of all of the managers I've had in my career. 


1. Terrific manager. Hired me, made me feel welcome, immediately left the company two weeks after I started



2. Replaced first manager, and immediately put me on performance improvement plan to try and get rid of me. Would find formatting errors, any sort of mistake or human error at all to tell me that I was a sloppy employee. Completely ignored any benefit I provided, and had no interest in working with me. Just wanted to build their own team, and I was in their way because I was already there


3. Hired me, and instead letting me get oriented into my role, decided to do what she called ""trial by fire"", just throw me into the deep and and see if I sink or swim. I excelled in my position, did everything better than expected, received praise often, but passed up for a promotion because only one person can be promoted. 


4. Completely incompetent, never actually did any of the subject that they were managing a team for. Ended up being fired for sexual harassment against many women on our team 



5. Came from another team to replace previous manager, gave me mountains of work and impossible goals and expectations to achieve, and even when achieving them, made up a bunch of excuses as to why I can't be promoted that made no sense. Glass ceiling, basically, can't be promoted unless you tell me that you want to be promoted, and X amount of years have passed, need X amount of outstanding performance reviews, etc


6. Actually a really good manager and all around good person. For the first year, great to work under them, they let me get situated in the role, let me get exposure to many different teams and departments, let me explore and provided coaching. However, after the first year, became very lazy as a manager. Never at their desk, always driving somewhere, scheduling meetings and then being 15 plus minutes late to them because again, they are driving somewhere, or not doing their job. Became extremely lazy and let errors slip through their fingers, and blame team members for them. Began making excuses when people wanted to be promoted 


7. The director above the previous manager in bullet point above. Completely worthless leader who came aboard to replace another director, and their first mission was to interrogate everyone on the team, and determine if their career goals were to stay in their current position. Anyone who desired career growth, or wanted to move up into management, or had career aspirations was immediately let go because they're ""Not a fit for our organizational goals"" 



The most common thing I have seen is that it is impossible to get promoted. Most positions at analyst level are designed so that no one can proceed into other positions because they want you to stay exactly where you are currently and not move up, they try to make it as difficult as possible for you to move up into other roles in the company. If you don't want to sit exactly where you are for at least 5 to 10 years, you're a bad employee, and there is no way to be promoted.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/17cfb97/i_have_never_had_a_manager_in_my_entire_career/

"R programmers, what are the greatest issues you have with Python?","I'm a Data Scientist with a computer science background. When learning programming and data science I learned first through Python, picking up R only after getting a job. After getting hired I discovered many of my colleagues, especially the ones with a statistics or economics background, learned programming and data science through R.

Whether we use Python or R depends a lot on the project but lately, we've been using much more Python than R. My colleagues feel sometimes that their job is affected by this, but they tell me that they have issues learning Python, as many of the tutorials start by assuming you are a complete beginner so the content is too basic making them bored and unmotivated, but if they skip the first few classes, you also miss out on important snippets of information and have issues with the following classes later on.

Inspired by that I decided to prepare a Python course that:

1. Assumes you already know how to program
2. Assumes you already know data science
3. Shows you how to replicate your existing workflows in Python
4. Addresses the main pain points someone migrating from R to Python feels

The problem is, I'm mainly a Python programmer and have not faced those issues myself, so I wanted to hear from you, have you been in this situation? If you migrated from R to Python, or at least tried some Python, what issues did you have? What did you miss that R offered? If you have not tried Python, what made you choose R over Python?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/15g96dc/r_programmers_what_are_the_greatest_issues_you/

Data Science job is BORING but I have so much free time. May I have some advice?,"I have been in my first DS job for almost 2 years now. It's really a Analyst job: dashboarding, basic queries, etc.

I have learned a good bit here: Python with Pandas and some basic linear regression, more ""complex"" SQL queries like multiple joins, CTEs, subqueries, and how to translate data into business needs.

The people here are all so nice and supportive, but there's nothing to do. Week after week it's the same requests, with an ad-hoc request maybe once every quarter. I have asked my team lead for more work or requests, but he says their is nothing at this time. I am pretty sure that the higher-ups know their is nothing to do, and part of me wonders if I'll be on the chopping block soon.

I have simply worked on kaggle projects until my eyes have bled, but for the past year I have just put a bottle of water on my spacebar to appear that I am online, then go walk my dog, go to the gym, play video games. Nobody even notices that I am gone, nor would they care as long as I get my work done.

On one hand, I am happy to have so much free time. On the other hand, I feel way far behind the average DS/DA when it comes to technical and interpersonal skills, so I'm wondering if I am shooting myself in the foot by having so much free time. I wouldn't be able to answer anything outside foundational skills in sql, python, or statistics.

Hiring Market Seems Crazy,"Or maybe I'm just doing something wrong. I just finished an MS in stats at a top 3 stats department, did my MS thesis research on self attention in transformers, undergrad double major in math and econ with CS minor, and I spent 1.5 years as a data science intern at a small but established sports analytics company during my masters program. Applying to upwards of 100 DS and machine learning roles online has landed me a total of zero (0) interviews. Every job posting has like 400+ applicants (as discussed in this thread [https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/15p8n46/is\_data\_sciencedata\_engineering\_over\_saturated/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/15p8n46/is_data_sciencedata_engineering_over_saturated/)).  Meanwhile there is more hype and investment than ever in ""ai"" and machine learning. Is this similar to other people's experiences? It's possible my resume just has some glaring issue I haven't discovered, but I'm starting to wonder how realistic starting a career in this field really is.

Edit:

First of all thanks to everyone offering their advice and perspective on my situation, and the job market at large. My goal here is to get a sense of whether or not there's a mismatch between my job hopes/expectations and my abilities, or if I'm just going about the job search incorrectly.

For those who asked for more details about my profile, I'll try to add some color here. I don't want to turn this into me listing my resume but maybe it will help me or others understand.

Some Relevant Skills:

Been programming in python for 6 years (web-scraping, pands, numpy, sklearn, pytorch, etc), practice leetcode pretty regularly. Have used for R for 3 years, but haven't touched it in about six months so a bit rusty. Lots of experience training and engineering neural nets in pytorch, this is my strongest skill imo. Have a few research projects using pytorch I did during my masters. Also obviously proficient with mathematical statistics and probability, the stuff you get from a stats ms.

​

Internship stuff:

Lots of people asked or brought up my internship, so I'll ad more about it. The company manages a large databse of college athletes and recruits and sells access and analysis to athletic programs. I joined as an intern winter of 2022, working part time during my masters. It's a small company with 10 full time employees, completely remote. There is one other programmer/tech guy but he mostly does does pandas/web-scraping/social media automation stuff, no stats/ml. There aren't any other data science/machine learning/stats people at the company, the owner/ceo has some experience and recently worked on a data sciency project but I think he spends most of his time managing the business. For the first 8 months I was essentially a software engineer/data engineer, writing python code to scrape and clean and move datasets. Last fall I started building a system that uses an llm to automate a monthly data entry project. This project was recurring every month, and usually took a group of 6 interns and 3 full time employees about a week to finish. My system now automates between 60% and 80% of it each month, most months its closer to 80%. The project is now typically done by two full time employees and maybe 1 intern. I'm now working on a project using boosted trees to find under/over recruited athletes. The owner/ceo of the company said I can add whatever title for my internship to my resume, since its a small company there aren't officially designated tracks or titles. I'm currently using ""Data Science Intern - Machine Learning"", but can change this to anything as long as it still accurately reflects what I've been doing.

​

Academic Stuff:

Thesis focused on self-attention in NMT and image classification, essentially showed that the common interpretation of self-attention working by ""comparing words in the input"" is wrong. Currently my advisor and I are working on extending the research, he wants to try to publish and so do I. 3.5 gpa in masters program (I know this isn't great but the school has a reputation for being hard/rigorous with no grade inflation, so maybe I'll be ok?). Undergrad GPA was 3.9, 4.0 if we only look at my major (few A- grades in humanities requirements). Was in honors program, wrote an honors thesis in math (algebraic geometry), got the ""best math student"" awards from my math department junior and senior year. I know since I have a master's the undergrad stuff is less important, but maybe that will help because it was a large non-elite university, mostly known for sports.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/15pzmfu/hiring_market_seems_crazy/
"What I wish I had known earlier in my career, particularly with disorganized companies"," I'm quoting directly from a Reddit user named funbike. This is the rule you should abide by in organizations. I also made the same mistake when I joined a company, attempting to prove myself.

"" 

After being a fool in my early career trying too hard to impress, this is how I handle this kind of thing these days:

* Document EVERYTHING. Follow-up verbal conversations with summary email. When things go south, I'll be able to prove I warned them.
* Give *realistic* estimates on how long things will take. Whatever I say is usually twice how long I actually think it will take, because things never go like you think.
* Make it clear that that longer-term estimates will be less accurate the farther out they are, because software is notoriously difficult to estimate.
* Tell them to their face that we *will not* make the unrealistic dates they've set, and to prevent in future to always consult first.
* I will *not* work overtime due to artificial deadlines. I'll do O/T for extreme exceptional cases only, such as a one-time short-term crisis or for a regulatory-mandated deadline. By 6pm I'll be at my house.
* Explain quality should never be abandoned for speed. It will violently backfire in the end, with the opposite effect.

I stand my ground. I can make them mildly unhappy now, or furiously disappointed in our results in the future. I'll take the first one please.

Even if you were to heroically meet their unreasonable date, they'll just expect more next time. You'll burn out and maybe the next time you'll have an embarrassing failure even with crazy overtime. They'll say ""tsk, tsk"" and blame you. Don't fall into this trap""",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/16y0vfi/what_i_wish_i_had_known_earlier_in_my_career/

Constant work anxiety is making me question data analytics as my choice of field,"I'm 22, currently pursing masters and working part-time with 2 (part-time) yoe as a data analyst in banking. I am hoping to eventually transition into data science.

While my job has definitely made life more comfortable financially, it's also taken a toll on my well-being due to the constant anxiety it causes me. This anxiety stems from worrying about various things, but the most significant would simply be the accuracy of results. 

I manage several reports and metrics calculations. Every time I am reporting it to the upper management, no matter how much time I spend double-checking everything, I spend the next week worying whether I could have messed up somewhere and how it would make me look like an incompetent idiot. At the end of the quarter I genuinely have nightmares about this stuff. I also have to admit that these fears aren't completely baseless as when I started this position, I did end up reporting one metric wrong for 2 months before I realised I messed up.

Now, I realise I have somewhat of a neurotic personality and I would have likely faced these issues no matter the field of work. However, I do feel like if the job were less analytical, it would definitely help to some degree. As a part-time employee, my responsibilities are relatively limited compared to most of my team mates, making me concerned that my anxiety may worsen as I transition to full-time.

Non-technical boss wants me to present results of a extremely ill-performing model to executives,"My background, in case it's relevant: I have a masters and PhD in data science, and I've been in my first data science role for about a year and a half.


I am a data scientist in a business intelligence department. When I joined, I inherited an extremely poor churn model - like ~10% precision, ~5% recall, ~91% accurate (due to imbalance). This thing was in production for over a year because my manager didn't realize that accuracy is a poor metric to use for imbalanced data.


I've spent the last year and a half redoing this model myself to a place where it is a lot better. But, my manager wants me to present the old model to executives. Now, if this were simply a comparison of the old one and the new one or an examination into why the old one didn't work so well, that would be fine. That's not what he wants. He wants me to present the model as if its predictions are perfect in order to show executives areas that we need to improve on in order to prevent churn.


This... makes no sense. E.g., let's say the old model classified old customers as most at-risk, but it's newer customers who actually churn more. Basing business decisions on the model's poor predictions is a really bad idea. 


To be clear, I don't have a problem making these slides. I have pushed back on the idea behind it, but I've never refused to do it. What I'm concerned about is that it's my name that's going on this and it's going to be presented as my sole effort, albeit from within the department, even though it's a model I had no hand in building whatsoever. My boss also has a tendency to throw people under the bus, and I feel like I'm being sacrificed.


I see a few options:


1. I can carefully word things so that I do not invite any conclusions drawn from my presentation whatsoever and also gently shut down any possible business decisions that might be made from this presentation.


2. I present it the way my boss wants but stay honest when anyone asks about the actual churn results and how much they differ from the model.


So basically, my questions are:


* Do I need to shut up and do as I'm told and act like a cog in the business machine? 


* Is this really normal business practice that I need to get used to? 


* Am I being dramatic?


* Or do I right to have a problem with this request? 


I am coming from academia where every little decision in the modeling process has to be justified and everything gets examined by multiple people, so maybe this is me just struggling to adapt to corporate life.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/181okvd/nontechnical_boss_wants_me_to_present_results_of/
Unrealistic entry-level position expectations?,"We are currently interviewing for entry-level candidates for a data scientist position with image-related applications. Most the candidates have had a masters qualification in 'data science' and most have had CNN experience listed on their CV. However they have not been able to convincingly answer the following questions:

* You mention CNNs on your CV; can you explain what a convolution is?

They may talk about masks and 'sliding'  but cannot go into the details of the mathematical operation.

* Can you explain a Type I and Type II error? What is a common trade-off between the two?

Complete blank from all candidates. If I clarify false-positive and false-negative the best candidates point out the importance of context but don't know about trade-offs.

* Your CV lists scikit learn, what is kNN clustering? How might you determine the optimum k parameter?

Most can explain kNN, the best candidates have suggested plotting the clusters with the data and eyeballing it however no-one has mentioned elbow or silhouette plots.

Is it unreasonable to expect solid answers to these questions?

Edit: I've quite rightly got criticism for confusing kNN and k-means. I should clarify that I have misrepresented a question from another interviewer. She sometimes asked if the candidate could explain kNN when it arose in the context of Nan replacement for data cleaning. Other times she asked if they knew about unsupervised learning and when k-means came up she would ask how do you determine k. She never asked about both during the same interview which I now understand was probably intentional but I had assumed she was asking about the same thing.


I should also clarify these were intended as 'stretch' questions and the majority of the interview was questions like 'can you tell us about the project you have listed on the application?'.

Each employee is unique so they are the ones who can best tell what they need to learn in order to (a) do better at work and also (b) grow in their career.

I feel many know what it is that they want to learn but cannot find time for it with their work load. And therefore, a dedicated learning week which can set expectations with all stakeholders that DS/analytics team is upgrading is must have. Maybe even employees can do knowledge sharing at end of week or start of next week. 

Company can eventually provide learning resources (courses, workshops, trainers etc.) but they shouldn't restrict employees on what they need to learn. It should at max be a discussion between employee and manager, where manager puts in suggestions but employee takes the final call. 

Please share your thoughts. Do you think such a thing would work?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/1abk6du/companies_should_give_employees_a_whole_week_with/
Where do the non-stupid people work?,"Edit: Thank you for all your insights. I have learned many people are totally fine with things breaking. In order for me to be a better coworker I need to accept and accommodate that. For example, if a server crashes and isn't fixed for 2 days I need to communicate that all our outputs may be MIA for two days and set that as the SLA.

Everyone I work with is a super smart moron. They’re super smart because they’re really good at engineering and can build really cool stuff. The problem is they don’t really care if their cool stuff actually works well. They don’t care about maintaining it or fixing issues quickly. They don’t care about providing status updates. Pretty basic stuff.

All my friends are experiencing the same issues I am facing. Their coworkers push code without testing. They approve untested code without verifying. They over engineer something because ”it’s cool” even if it runs like shit.

So I ask, where do the non-stupid people work?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/18yi3bi/where_do_the_nonstupid_people_work/

Does anyone not really care about ChatGPT and LLMs?,"Sorry in advance if this post becomes a rant or is overly negative. I don't mean it to be.

So on one hand ChatGPT and LLMs are really impressive. It's really cool you can give a prompt and get a response that is almost or exactly what you asked for. But I'm already tried of hearing everyone talk about it constantly.

The fact it can create code is amazing, however it can ""hallucinate"" and create package and functions that don't exist... I mean, this is impressive, but is this useful? To create boilerplate code that you have to review before using? Why not write it from scratch? Even if the LLM gives you code that is syntactically correct, is it even quality code?

Again I know I probably sound like an old man or something, but it's annoying hearing about it constantly (I guess I'm not helping by posting about it :)).

"Why some data science interviews suck, as an interviewer...","I know a number of people express annoyance at interviews on this sub. I was raked over the coals a few months ago for apparently bad interview questions but my latest experience blows that out the water. I thought I'd give my experience from the other side of the desk which may go some way to showing why it can be so bad.

I received a message last week saying that an online assessor for a Graduate Data Scientist role had dropped out and they needed volunteers to stand in. I volunteered to help.

Someone from HR sent me an email with a link to a training video and the interview platform. I watched the 30 min video at 1.5 speed which was mostly stuff like which buttons to press.

The day before I logged onto the assessment portal I reviewed the questions. I noticed that the questions were very generic but thought there might be some 'calibration' briefing before the interviews; it was too late to speak to HR.

Before the assessment day there was a HR call 30 mins before. It turned out to be just to check if anyone had technical issues. There was no 'calibration' brief. The call ended after 10 mins as the HR rep had to leave to chase no shows.

I was dropped straight into a 'technical' interview 1 on 1 with the candidate. Although it was apparently technical most of the questions were very generic. E.g. Walk me through a project where you had to solve a problem.

There were criteria associated with the questions but there was no way you would answer them as the interviewee unless prompted. E.g in the above question a criterion might be 'The candidate readily accepts new ideas'. Given the short time (5 mins per question) it was not really possible to prompt for every criterion but I did try to enable the candidate to score highly but it meant the questioning was very disjointed.

After a few of these there was the 'technical' section. These questions seemed to be totally left-field. E.g. you have two identical-size metal cubes how could you differentiate the material they are made of? Obviously this question is useless for the role and the CS-background interviewee needed lots of coaching to answer this.

Next I had a soft skills interview with a different candidate. The questions again were vague and sensible answers would not meet the criteria.

Finally there was a group activity and we were supposed to observe the 'teamwork' but the team just split the tasks and got on with them individually so there was hardly anything to observe.

After this the HR bod asked us to complete all the assessments and submit them. Then we'd have a 'wash up'. The wash up was basically the place where scoring could be calibrated by discussing with the other assessors. Of course, the scores had already been submitted by then so this was entirely pointless.

I also asked about the inappropriate technical questions and they said they didn't get the DS questions in time so had just used other technical questions (we were hiring other engineers/scientists at the same time).

So, as you can see, HR ruin everything they touch and hiring is a HR process so it's terrible. Sorry if you had to go through this.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/17kvjmp/why_some_data_science_interviews_suck_as_an/

Contractors who are called Data Scientists but can't do what I'd expect. What to do next.,"Ok so, I was hired as a senior member of a pre-existing data science team. I now manage a few other team members (who were there before me). They are all contractors and their day rate is HIGH. They are all 'Data Scientists' and graduates.

I'm older. I've done lots of technical roles and I'm not really sure what my official title is. I can do data science but I really just build stuff. I've done Data Engineering in the past, MLOps, DevOps, Cloud etc. I'm a jack of all trades, master of none.

Now, I know what ***I think*** a 'Data Scientist' should be able to do:

1. Pandas, Numpy, Scikit learn, matplotlib blah blah blah
2. Version control (Git)
3. Managing virtual environments
4. Debugging within an IDE
5. Scoping out a project, ideation, exploration
6. Report writing skills/communication skills
7. Some exposure to clean code conventions (PEP-8)
8. Some exposure to SQL like syntax
9. bit of linux would be cool (I can teach them)
10. bit of cloud would be cool (I can teach them)

I've had to mentor the team HARD. Most of the team did not know what Git was, most of the team had never debugged their code, never made a venv. In fact I have had to teach them steps 1-5. That would be fine if they were now hitting the ground running, but the moment I stop mentoring them, the productivity stops. No initiative.

And yet, I want to hire externally. I want to give them the opportunity to apply but I just know they won't measure up against the talent pool out there. I've hired Data Scientists before and I know how good people are out there.

Am I totally wrong? Do I need to cut them some slack? Anyone got any comments?

"[P] Just released the first batch of 1,000 perfectly synchronised AI sex toy scripts for 180º POV VR porn videos","We started exploring automated scripts creation for 180º POV VR porn videos some two years ago as these were in strong demand on the SexLikeReal platform. The idea of interactive sex toys is to perfectly match the movement in the video with up to frame precision. It's an up and down stroker realtime synced with a video player while watching VR (also works with smartphones now).

Only 1 in 20 videos was scripted and the gap was growing exponentially. It takes up to two weeks to script manually. There are some very few people on Earth knowing the craft and the demand is growing fast with interactive sex toys hitting the market and becoming popular. Now we are looking to render 1,000 scripts in an hour.

We trained the model on 1,300 craft scripts created over many years and started to fine tune algorithms working hard with script creators and testers. One step after another and it started getting better. What was expected to be somewhat ok turned to be a cool product with quality much better than expected.

The scripts are generated at first pass. There was a manual QA in place while testing. Now it becomes a problem as we don't have capacity to come over thousands of scripts.

It's the first successful AI scripts attempt 🔥

Scripts: NSFW https://www.sexlikereal.com/tags/sex-toy-scripts-vr?type=ai NSFW

The reaction of the script creating guru we worked with was priceless:
>these again were all fully automated no manual touch ups? If so, then this is pretty huge improvements from the last

>no more harsh strokes anywhere
>depths are alot better matched than previous
>missed strokes in large sections seem to now have all been captured
>even obstruction parts are significantly improved
>important variety is still maintained in the script
>Script 10100 can be released as is, most guys wont notice anything problematic if at all
>(you could probably release them all and ‘most’ would be fine with them - especially if they havent tried a manual script for them). Biggest improvement is scene 34865 which is night and day difference. There isnt a whole left to improve to be honest as most guys will probably enjoy theseThese are the best AI versions I’ve seen to date.

Are all higher level data science jobs like this?,"I'm really not sure how to summarize this concisely in a neat title, so just let me explain.

At previous lower level jobs, we were organized. We had ticketing tracking systems, step-by-step procedures for all of the commonly done work, we had checklists that people could sign off on as they completed work. And most importantly, even for one-off requests, the primary mode of communication was email. That way, I had the project specifications and/or updates spelled out in front of me that I could refer back to whenever needed.

As I get higher up in the field at different companies, I'm finding the primary mode of communication is virtual meetings. All of the background, specifications, and next steps are given verbally, and I'm sitting here in these meetings furiously trying to write everything down that is being said. What's worse is that the ideas for the projects often aren't fully developed and we have to figure them out so I get a lot of ""do this, actually no, let's do it this way, but I'm actually thinking it would be better to approach it this way....."". AS you can imagine it makes fully understanding the next steps of a given projects difficult. If I use my judgement and approach it the way I feel is best, half the time it's end up not being what management wants and I have to waste their time and mine on rework. 

One of the ways I tried to work around management's brain dumps on me was to recap back to them what the next steps they wanted from me were, but they're ***super busy*** so they always join the meetings late, and as a result we frequently run out of time.  75% of the time I try to message or email them with questions they just don't respond, so the only way I can get any info out of them is via virtual meetings. This is creating an environment for me that makes mistakes easier to happen, and it's turning into a situation where I can do 9 things right, but if I missed or misunderstood the 10th thing, I'm getting crucified for it (meanwhile this is a common occurrence for management but that's a different rant.....) I'm being made to feel like it's a shortcoming of mine for not being able to take down everything accurately.

I know some people can thrive in these conditions. For me, it's tough. I'm definitely a scatterbrain and I try to compensate for this by being as organized as humanly possible, but it's just easier said than done when most everything is being given ONLY verbally. I understand that the higher you go in data science, the less routine and the more exploratory and R&D your work becomes, so having clearly documented procedures becomes less realistic. But if this is the way most of these positions are going to be, I really don't feel like this field is for me.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/17jtkgv/are_all_higher_level_data_science_jobs_like_this/

As a new graduate recently I am getting a data analyst offer from a casino resort. It's a hard time for new grad and after two times of withdrawals of my offers, this is the only one I have in my hands. The job duty is about analyzing campaign performance, analyzing customer patterns, and forecasting business trends.  They are also working on breaking data silos utilizing cloud service so ETL jobs should also be expected.

Overall the project sounds pretty attractive to me. My only concern is the business itself. One of my friends (not in US) gave me a strong suggestion that don't easily go into this industry. He was working in an operation role for company building mobile casinos, and the business logic was so different from other industries that it's hard to get out of this. Many people have a bias toward this career so he had a hard time changing jobs.

I am scared, to be honest. But I am not sure to what extent his thoughts work in my scenario. Casino Resort still looks much different from mobile casinos and his role was not data analyst.

Bouncing back after a bad work experience as a data scientist in an organization,"Hi everyone,

I had to quit my job as a senior data scientist in my company because of constant negative feedback from my managers, stress and health issues. I lost my confidence completely once I was put on a PIP and quit my job the next day. I don't have a job right now. 

I feel it's really hard but not impossible to bounce back from this ""failure"". First of all, I'm taking some time off to take care of my physical and mental health by doing strength training, meditation and Yoga, working on my diet, spending time with family etc. 

Secondly, I'm trying to focus on my strengths (computer vision and deep learning) and working on toy problems related to object detection and segmentation to get my mojo back. But the sheer amount of stuff that a data scientist is supposed to know is just too overwhelming for me.

"How complex ARE your models in Industry, really? (Imposter Syndrome)","Perhaps some imposter syndrome, or perhaps not...**basically--how complex ARE your models, realistically, for industry purposes?** 

""Industry Purposes"" in the sense of answering business questions, such as:

* Build me a model that can predict whether a free user is going to convert to a paid user. (Prediction)
* Here's data from our experiment on Button A vs. Button B, which Button should we use? (Inference)
* Based on our data from clicks on our website, should we market towards Demographic A? (Inference)

I guess inherently I'm approaching this scenario from a prediction or inference perspective, and not from like a ""building for GenAI or Computer Vision"" perspective.

------------------

I know (and have experienced) that a lot of the work in Data Science is prepping and cleaning the data, but I always feel a little imposter syndrome when I spend the bulk of my time doing that, and then throw the data into a package that creates like a ""black-box"" Random Forest model that spits out the model we ultimately use or deploy.

Sure, along the way I spend time tweaking the model parameters (for a Random Forest example--tuning # of trees or depth) and checking my train/test splits, communicating with stakeholders, gaining more domain knowledge, etc., but ""creating the model"" once the data is cleaned to a reasonable degree is just loading things into a package and letting it do the rest. Feels a little too simple and cheap in some respects...especially for the salaries commanded as you go up the chain.

And since a lot of money is at stake based on the model performance, it's always a little nerve-wracking to hinge yourself on some black-box model that performed well on your train/test data and ""hope"" it generalizes to unseen data and makes the company some money.

Definitely much less stressful when it's just projects for academics or hypotheticals where there's no real-world repercussions...there's always that voice in the back of my head saying ""surely, something as simple as this needs to be improved for the company to deem it worth investing so much time/money/etc. into, right?""

------------------

Anyone else feel this way? Normal feeling--get used to it over time? Or is it that the more experience you gain, the bulk of ""what you are paid for"" isn't necessarily developing complex or novel algorithms for a business question, but rather how you communicate with stakeholders and deal with data-related issues, or similar stuff like that...?

------------------

**EDIT: Some good discussion about what types of models people use on a daily basis for work, but beyond saying ""I use Random Forest/XGBoost/etc."", do you incorporate more complexity besides the ""simple"" pipeline of: Clean Data -> Import into Package and do basic Train/Test + Hyperparameter Tuning + etc., -> Output Model for Use?**",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/1akjw7t/how_complex_are_your_models_in_industry_really/

My work published without my name. Need your advice,"This is probably something that has been discussed a lot. However, I want to share my story and get your feedback. 

A few years ago, I was part of an unofficial research group. No contracts or any type of payment was involved. The lead of the group was a university professor. 

During that period, a colleague and I worked on a project with a case study of a prediction model. My colleague did the machine learning model and I designed the architecture and developed a platform that consumed the model and provided results and visualisations. 

We submitted it to a competition as a group but we didn’t get the first place. 

Fast forward. I am in industry now and don’t have plans to return to academia. Found out that a few months ago, that work got published in a journal with Author 1: my colleague, Author 2: the professor and Author 3 someone external that never worked on it. 

I was never asked about it. Author 1 said that he tried to include me but Author 2 was against it since I am not part of the group anymore. There are other dependencies between the two and he didn’t want to push it more. 

It’s not an innovation or an impressive work. I never thought of publishing it. However I feel cheated. 

The code of the platform is in my personal gitlab and I have mail communications explaining to others how to install and use it. 

I don’t want to create any issue to author 1. But how do you think I should handle this? I only ended up mentioning in the acknowledgement section.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/15wasa1/my_work_published_without_my_name_need_your_advice/
Is it realistic to become a self taught data scientist?,"So I'm studying economics in my second year and for the last month and a half I've been learning python and I've been  enjoying it.
I've been reading about data science and I'm really interested in it, however I wanted to ask if there are any self taught data scientist and what resources you used.
Sorry if what I say seems naive.
Thank you

I was just asked to fudge the numbers,"This particular project is for client-facing stakeholders. My team lead and I are tasked with automating several of their data-driven slides on Tableau that they currently manually produce not sure how or where.

One particular slide is a pie chart (yeah, I know) that splits the data into ~10 different segments or so, each with its % of market share.

We did so, and they complained that the numbers percentage points add up to 98%.

We explained that it's because of rounding, and if we included the decimal it would add up to 100%.

They started going on about how they present this to CFOs and they'll ask why it doesn't add up to 100% and it has to be perfect and etc.

So we offered to show the decimal, but nope, can't do that because it's ""hard to read.""

Remember how they produce those manually at the moment? They said, and I quote, ""sometimes I change a 3% to a 4% to make it work, because what's 1% more?""

I can kind of understand changing 20% to 21%, because that's only a 5% difference. But really, 3% to 4%? A whopping 33% difference?

Anyway, I'm not about to tell them how to do their job, since I can barely do mine. Lord knows I have no idea how to automate this arbitrary number-fudging on Tableau, so I'll have to figure that one out (it has to be automated so that it adds up to 100% no matter what data ranges the user chooses). 

But I just wonder, how hard is it to tell a CFO ""yeah, it doesn't add up to 100% because of rounding, but if we included the decimals it would""?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/12qzs1k/i_was_just_asked_to_fudge_the_numbers/
Can you have a successful career in this industry/field if you aren’t obsessed with it?,"I write this purely out of curiosity because I’m wondering if anyone else can relate to my situation.

I’m [M27] a Senior Data Analyst in the UK, with a Physics background and PhD. I’ve generally always enjoyed learning and understand new concepts and ideas. 

After my PhD I left academia for industry - not because I didn’t like my subject, but because I wanted a permanent role away from the toxicity and pressure/risk of academia, with a 9-5 where I can switch off at the end of the day. Data seemed like a good starting point since I’d worked with it in my PhD.

On top of that, I didn’t want my subject to become my life - I enjoy far too many things outside of work to want to do it in my free time - I like sports, gaming, travelling, going for coffee, and all that lot. 

So, when I see people talking about their personal projects on GitHub it starts to make me wonder or question whether I’m in the right industry. Even when somebody creates a graph or produces some stats related to something I’m interested in, like Fantasy Premier League, it’s cool, but I have no desire to go and do that myself.

This is leading me to worry that long-term, I worry that I won’t be able to compete with the people who do genuinely live and breathe data 24/7. I’m just not “obsessed” with it. I see it as a job. 

I also don’t want my lack of “obsession” (if you want to call it that) be perceived for a lack of motivation or being someone who is lazy. I still want to progress over time, but above all I want to be comfortable.

Does anyone else feel the same way?

Hiring hell,"Gonna keep this short because I know we hate talking about hiring 24/7, but I genuinely couldn’t believe what my team just went through. 

Medium sized financial firm and from top, there’s 10 or so positions specifically for new grads next May.

We posted our position and got 200+ applicants in a week. 

And sifting through them were a nightmare. So so many people who weren’t new grads when the description specifically said that, were analysts using excel, weren’t graduating programs but data boot camps, had rip-off personal projects at the top of their resume. 

It was infuriating. 
Finally got down to 10 for interviews, and ended up reaching out to internship managers to inquire about the kids. Several good reviews and we had 3 really impress us in technical interviews. 

Ended up with a pretty good one that accepted graduating with Comp Sci and Math, but still, it’s mind boggling that so many people apply to job postings they’re WAY under qualified for.  

Just a rant.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/16yc89t/hiring_hell/
A Data science manager is just a manager,"As a data scientist from the days before it was a buzzword, I've had the hard journey from frustration over the lack of innovative projects at my company to ascending the ranks with the aim of being in the position to spearheading such initiatives. Initially, I thought the barrier was a lack of vision among decision-makers, but as I climbed the corporate ladder, I discovered the real challenge was not just creating groundbreaking projects, but ensuring their adoption within the company. Despite becoming proficient at the art of selling ideas and achieving some significant successes, the demands of management now consume all my time. I find myself mired in meetings, one-on-ones, and endless slide decks, leaving no space for the very innovation I sought to promote. This paradox highlighted a crucial lesson: having the power to initiate change doesn't guarantee the capacity to execute it, especially in a field where the talent for both data science and leadership is rare. The question then becomes: how do you find the balance?

Edit: To clarify, I do not feel the need to code or even solve develop the solution my self. I just want to be part of the internal innovation process and not be stuck maintaining a custom product a consultancy company got to build.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/1b4inht/a_data_science_manager_is_just_a_manager/
Do you also wrap your data processing functions in classes?,"I work in a team of data scientists on time series forecasting pipelines, and I have the feeling that my colleagues overuse OOP paradigms. Let us say we have two dataframes, and we have a set of functions which calculates some deltas between them:

    def calculate_delta(df1: pd.DataFrame, df2: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        delta = # some calculations incl. more functions
        return delta
    
    delta = calculate_delta(df1, df2)

What my coleagues usually do with this, that they wrap this function in a class, something like:

    class DeltaCalculatorProcessor:
        def __init__(self, df1: pd.DataFrame, df2: pd.DataFrame):
            self.__df1 = df1
            self.__df2 = df2
            self.__delta = pd.DataFrame()
    
        def calculate_delta(self) -> pd.DataFrame:
            ... # update self.__delta calculated from self.__df1 and self.__df2 using more class methods
            return self.__delta

And then they call it with

    dcp = DeltaCalculatorProcessor(df1, df2)
    delta = dcp.calculate_delta()

They always do this, even if they don't use this class more than once, so practically they just add yet another abstraction layer on the top of a set of functions, saying that ""this is how professional software developers do"", ""this is industrial best practice"" etc.

Do you also do this in your team? Maybe I have PTSD from having been a Java programmer before for ages, but I find the excessive use of classes for code structuring actually harder to maintain than just simply organizing the codes with functions, especially for data pipelines (where the input is a set of dataframes and the output is also a set of dataframes).

P.S. I wanted to keep my example short, so I haven't shown more smaller functions inside calculate_delta(). But the emphasis is not that they would wrap 1 single function in a class; but that they wrap a set of functions in a class without any further reasons (the wrapper class is not re-used, there is no internal state to maintain etc.). So the full app could be organized with pure functions, they just wrap the functions in ""Processor"" and ""Orchestrator"" classes, using one time classes for code organization.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/1bmoyzu/do_you_also_wrap_your_data_processing_functions/
10 years+ in Data Science and I am stuck,"Currently work as a Data Science Tech Lead in an Insurance AI lab with 20+ data scientist. Overlooking 3 squads, coaching senior DS & maintaining technical quality. The lab mainly do NLP research & projects are interesting.

It sounds great but I feel depressed & pessimistic with the career outlook.

I worked my way up from data analyst (excel) to ML Scientsit (building NLP model) to DS tech lead (governance).

The higher the career ladder, the fewer chance for me to actually write code & touch the data, and instead I mainly talk to architect, draw diagram & give high level comments on sprint review.

The worst is...the decline in technical skill, and the invisible ceiling of career.

Data Scientist is never (really) the bread & butter of a company. Yes we can build ML model that generate business value, but rarely the core business.

That also means up to certain level, the only way up is to manage people & focus on the business side.

The coming trend of LLM is worrying too (for all DS working in NLP)

Why so many people think that having a PhD (or postdoc) is an easy pass for getting a job in data science?,"Hey!

Some posts on this subreddit recently left me wondering why so many people with PhDs think that's an easy pass for data science. 

I get that a PhD is counted towards work experience (and rightly so) but it's still very much different compared to **modern** data science where the required skillset is far broader and tends to cover things from prototyping to deployment. 

Or perhaps I'm mistaken and a PhD undeniably makes a candidate stronger and more competitive (feel free to challenge me on that as I'm really not sure)

My intuition is that a PhD sort of gives guarantees that the candidate can work independently as well as in a team and can conduct research and analysis. As for knowledge expertise, don't you feel like that most DS jobs aren't actually SOTA research of the likes of Meta and Netflix (thus a PhD doesn't really add up much value to the equation)?

Anyway, just a random question :)

They Want To Promote Me. I Don't Know What I'm Doing,"So, as above, I currently work in supply chain, at a warehouse as a data operator. Just something to tide me over while I complete my business degree.

Vector Databases 101,"We're in the midst of the AI revolution, where groundbreaking language models are released almost every week, captivating our imagination. But as we marvel at these impressive models, do we truly understand the technology that powers and stores them? Enter vector databases – the hidden powerhouse behind the scenes. In this article, we'll embark on a journey to demystify vector databases, unravelling the fundamental concepts, applications, and their indispensable role in supporting and harnessing the potential of cutting-edge AI models.

In the world of AI, large language models heavily rely on vector embeddings, which are representations of data that carry semantic information. These embeddings have numerous attributes or features, making them complex to manage. In simple terms, the process of converting raw data into vectors is crucial to preserve information and relationships. To achieve this, we employ an embedding model that takes the raw data as input and generates vector embeddings. By passing the raw data through the embedding model, we ensure that the resulting vector embeddings retain significant information and capture the underlying relationships present in the data. This conversion enables efficient processing, analysis, and comparisons of the data in a more compact and meaningful vector representation.

&#x200B;

[Vector Embedding Process](https://preview.redd.it/5hufgl68z38b1.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc0518393865f472b63a3d3943a4cd1c64d1f2a7)

Traditional databases struggle to handle the scale and complexity of this data, hindering real-time analysis and insights. That's where vector databases come in.

Vector databases are designed specifically to handle vector embeddings, offering performance, scalability, and flexibility. They enable advanced features like semantic information retrieval and long-term memory for AI models. Here's how they work:

1. Generating Embeddings: An embedding model creates vector embeddings for the content we want to index, capturing essential patterns and relationships.
2. Inserting into the Database: The vector embeddings are inserted into the vector database, along with references to the original content they were created from.
3. Querying the Database: When an application issues a query, the same embedding model generates embeddings for the query. These query embeddings are used to search the vector database for similar vector embeddings.
4. Retrieving Associated Content: The vector database returns similar embeddings along with the associated original content.

&#x200B;

[Vector Database Workflow](https://preview.redd.it/8eex0vfcz38b1.png?width=1399&format=png&auto=webp&s=243b1b98602e318fa1cab87ca8376366630d0af2)

**How does a vector database work?**

Unlike traditional databases that match exact values, vector databases use similarity metrics to find the most similar vectors to a query. They employ algorithms like Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search, optimizing search through techniques like hashing, quantization, or graph-based search.

A typical vector database pipeline includes:

1. Indexing: Vectors are indexed using algorithms like PQ, LSH, or HNSW, mapping them to a data structure for faster searching.
2. Querying: The vector database compares the indexed query vector with the indexed vectors in the dataset to find the nearest neighbours based on similarity.
3. Post Processing: In some cases, the vector database retrieves the nearest neighbours from the dataset and applies additional processing, such as re-ranking using a different similarity measure, to provide the final results.

&#x200B;

By employing these techniques, vector databases offer fast and accurate retrieval, striking a balance between speed and accuracy.

In summary, vector databases are tailored for managing vector embeddings, enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of complex AI data. Their unique capabilities play a vital role in powering advanced AI applications and unlocking the true potential of AI models.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/14ieyfs/vector_databases_101/

From Data-Driven to Data-Ignored… a disappointing shift at Amazon,"https://preview.redd.it/3n4q0xzevjgb1.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=38bb199895cb4217c70a1a0f1431ee721d26f45b

I couldn't help but feel the need to share my frustration with the way some executives handle decision-making processes, especially when it comes to “data-driven” decisions. The recent example from Amazon's senior leadership really got me boiling, and I just had to get this off my chest.

As a data science practitioner myself… it's disheartening to see executives in both my field and beyond often using data points to validate their existing beliefs rather than *truly* utilizing data to guide their decisions. The cornerstone of our work is to analyze and interpret data objectively to uncover insights that inform strategic choices. Yet, time and again, we witness decisions driven by personal preferences and opinions rather than evidence.

Amazon has long been regarded as a paragon of data-driven decision-making, and rightly so. The company has access to vast amounts of data and has used it effectively to shape their strategies and operations, such as Dynamic Pricing, Warehouse Optimization, and Fraud Detection. However, when I read about Mike Hopkins' statements regarding the return to office, I was shocked at the blatant disregard for fundamental data-driven principles.

Let's break this down… Hopkins, a senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios, made a bold statement in an internal meeting, stating that it's time to return to the office without providing *any* substantial data to back up his claim. He says, ""I don't have data to back it up, but I know it's better.""

The essence of data-driven decision-making lies in using objective data to support or reject a belief or hypothesis. By admitting that he lacks the data to back up his position, Hopkins is essentially admitting that he's making an uninformed decision, and worse yet, he's trying to influence others to follow suit blindly.

What's even more infuriating is that this kind of behavior is not *that* uncommon among senior management, even in my own personal experience. Many of them already have preconceived notions or personal preferences, and they cherry-pick data points to support their beliefs while conveniently ignoring any data that contradicts them. The complete opposite of what Data Science is meant to achieve.

Data-driven decision-making is crucial, especially when it comes to complex matters like remote work. Many employees have adapted to working from home, and some even prefer it due to increased flexibility and work-life balance. Forcing a return to the office without concrete data to support the move is a clear sign of executive arrogance and a lack of respect for their employees' preferences and well-being.

It's hard to believe that a company as data-driven as Amazon wouldn't have data on the productivity and effectiveness of remote work… the company likely has access to a *trove* of information that could shed light on the effectiveness of remote work, including productivity metrics, employee satisfaction surveys, and more. It's puzzling why they would not utilize this data to inform their decisions, especially when the well-being and productivity of their workforce are at stake. Without clear and data-backed justifications, employees may feel undervalued and may question the credibility of leadership's intentions.

Amazon's senior leadership should remember their commitment to data-driven principles and engage in transparent decision-making. If there are legitimate reasons to return to the office, they owe it to their employees to present the data and engage in an open discussion about the pros and cons. By withholding critical information, they are undermining trust and potentially making decisions that could hurt the company in the long run.

As a data science practitioner, I believe it's not just about having access to data; it's also about using it responsibly and ethically. Using data to back up preconceived beliefs, or worse, hiding data that counters those beliefs, undermines the credibility and ethics of data science as a field and the trust we place in data-driven decision-making.

In conclusion, the misuse and omission of data by executives is not only frustrating to witness but also detrimental to the progress of organizations. I find it incredibly disappointing that executives at Amazon, a company known for being data-driven, would advocate for a return to the office without any supporting data. As data scientists, we have a responsibility to advocate for the ethical and rigorous use of data, and as consumers and employees, we have the right to demand evidence-based decision-making from the companies we support.

Am I alone in this? I'd love to hear the community’s thoughts on this matter.

TL;DR: Amazon's senior leadership's recent push for a return to office without any supporting data is a disappointment to their reputation as a data-driven company. Executives should practice what they preach and make decisions based on objective data rather than personal beliefs or preferences. This behavior is not only disrespectful to employees but also detrimental to the company's long-term success. When data takes a backseat it flies in the face of what Data Science is all about.

WTF do people use SAS for? Should I learn this?,"I've been looking for My next job recently, and went through all of the questions with the hiring manager, and basically provided insight that I am advanced in everything he asked about. SQL, Tableau, databases, data analytics, everything... Except SAS. I said I was basic, I've used it once or twice, but it hasn't been a core part of any of the roles that I've fulfilled in the past. Even though I am a stellar candidate, absolute brilliant level of skill in everything else in terms of data analytics and managing projects related to that, he said it wouldn't be a good fit because it's very heavy in SAS....



so now i'm kind of confused .... I have been in data analytics for about 4 years now, have never used SAS. Never. Have never even been asked about it on an interview or anything...

Of the few DS jobs, some of the JD asks for a lot more engineering skills like spark, cloud computing and deployment than they asked stats.

Visualizing What Batch Normalization Is and Its Advantages," Optimizing your neural network training with Batch Normalization 

[Visualizing What Batch Normalization Is and Its Advantages](https://preview.redd.it/dah6fe3kgigc1.png?width=999&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0f8a08ae05cf2989d109ae274b6f65e5cc83002)

# Introduction

 Have you, when conducting deep learning projects, ever encountered a situation where the more layers your neural network has, the slower the training becomes? 

 If your answer is YES, then congratulations, it's time for you to consider using batch normalization now. 

# What is Batch Normalization?

 As the name suggests, batch normalization is a technique where batched training data, after activation in the current layer and before moving to the next layer, is standardized. Here's how it works: 

1. *The entire dataset is randomly divided into N batches without replacement, each with a mini\_batch size, for the training.*
2. *For the i-th batch, standardize the data distribution within the batch using the formula:* *(Xi - Xmean) / Xstd**.*
3. *Scale and shift the standardized data with* *γXi + β* *to allow the neural network to undo the effects of standardization if needed.*

 The steps seem simple, don't they? So, what are the advantages of batch normalization? 

# Advantages of Batch Normalization

### Speeds up model convergence

 Neural networks commonly adjust parameters using gradient descent. If the cost function is smooth and has only one lowest point, the parameters will converge quickly along the gradient. 

 But if there's a significant variance in the data distribution across nodes, the cost function becomes less like a pit bottom and more like a valley, making the convergence of the gradient exceptionally slow. 

 Confused? No worries, let's explain this situation with a visual: 

 First, prepare a virtual dataset with only two features, where the distribution of features is vastly different, along with a target function: 

    rng = np.random.default_rng(42)
    
    A = rng.uniform(1, 10, 100)
    B = rng.uniform(1, 200, 100)
    
    y = 2*A + 3*B + rng.normal(size=100) * 0.1  # with a little bias

 Then, with the help of GPT, we use matplot3d to visualize the gradient descent situation before data standardization: 

[ Visualization of cost functions without standardization of data.  ](https://preview.redd.it/s7zorqm9higc1.png?width=537&format=png&auto=webp&s=f92388f9e3384eee96ce2585b7bc70f25392cee9)

 Notice anything? Because one feature's span is too large, the function's gradient is stretched long in the direction of this feature, creating a valley. 

 Now, for the gradient to reach the bottom of the cost function, it has to go through many more iterations. 

 But what if we standardize the two features first? 

    def normalize(X):
        mean = np.mean(X)
        std = np.std(X)
        return (X - mean)/std
    
    A = normalize(A)
    B = normalize(B)

 Let's look at the cost function after data standardization: 

[ Visualization of standardized cost functions for data. ](https://preview.redd.it/5ou0awyehigc1.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=72c3f4dd14b78d52f0fe1396a0c131d19e0f6aea)

 Clearly, the function turns into the shape of a bowl. The gradient simply needs to descend along the slope to reach the bottom. Isn't that much faster? 

### Slows down the problem of gradient vanishing

 The graph we just used has already demonstrated this advantage, but let's take a closer look. 

 Remember this function? 

[ Visualization of sigmoid function.  ](https://preview.redd.it/jl3cyhojhigc1.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c2e2047317d99d89b9232b37fa28652eb10f7bd)

 Yes, that's the sigmoid function, which many neural networks use as an activation function. 

 Looking closely at the sigmoid function, we find that the slope is steepest between -2 and 2. 

[ The slope of the sigmoid function is steepest between -2 and 2. ](https://preview.redd.it/j6l02trmhigc1.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=504efbe5562e9b477a4c48e943011dca7bab5fa7)

 If we reduce the standardized data to a straight line, we'll find that these data are distributed exactly within the steepest slope of the sigmoid. At this point, we can consider the gradient to be descending the fastest. 

[ The normalized data will be distributed in the steepest interval of the sigmoid function. ](https://preview.redd.it/kk0mrflphigc1.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=43d1dbc9b1a63952a41730146bfd624db97b2b4d)

 However, as the network goes deeper, the activated data will drift layer by layer (Internal Covariate Shift), and a large amount of data will be distributed away from the zero point, where the slope gradually flattens. 

[ The distribution of data is progressively shifted within the neural network. ](https://preview.redd.it/6y088bkthigc1.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=69ebded75578b8a0daad7874d3803b926db74363)

 At this point, the gradient descent becomes slower and slower, which is why with more neural network layers, the convergence becomes slower. 

 If we standardize the data of the mini\_batch again after each layer's activation, the data for the current layer will return to the steeper slope area, and the problem of gradient vanishing can be greatly alleviated. 

[ The renormalized data return to the region with the steepest slope.  ](https://preview.redd.it/pmkgqpuwhigc1.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=84ce3916984707d86f314a3dc458f403b0584999)

### Has a regularizing effect

 If we don't batch the training and standardize the entire dataset directly, the data distribution would look like the following: 

[ Distribution after normalizing the entire data set. ](https://preview.redd.it/a0nuru70iigc1.png?width=484&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bd763b5d450599cb6527089e01b0a1735aac4cb)

 However since we divide the data into several batches and standardize the data according to the distribution within each batch, the data distribution will be slightly different. 

[ Distribution of data sets after normalization by batch. ](https://preview.redd.it/of8wlwc2iigc1.png?width=484&format=png&auto=webp&s=16ad7cf81a7c08512399e7681ff3bce8568d11e7)

 You can see that the data distribution has some minor noise, similar to the noise introduced by Dropout, thus providing a certain level of regularization for the neural network. 

## Conclusion

 Batch normalization is a technique that standardizes the data from different batches to accelerate the training of neural networks. It has the following advantages: 

* Speeds up model convergence.
* Slows down the problem of gradient vanishing.
* Has a regularizing effect.

Post layoff depression,"It took me a while to get my first DS job. 10 years into my tech career and I finally found what I was looking for. 2 years after I started we got hit bad by layoffs and my job was cut. I know we’re all supposed to trek on but I can’t help but shake the sadness. How are you all dealing with it and does the market look any better lately?

Does working in a large corporation ever get less depressing and more interesting?,"After almost 5 years spent in research (I have a MSc in Physics)  I was just annoyed to use my time in order to produce results that would eventually end up in a research paper to be forgotten after a few months: I didn't see any purpose in that. That's why in 2019 I moved to the industry by applying as Data Scientist to a large corporation. I really hoped the industry would give me more practical applications of my knowledge; I was wrong.

Since I joined the company I've been bouncing back and forth between different projects where I would have plenty of meetings discussing general stuff, without ever going into the details. Every time we were getting to something concrete it was said that I shouldn't do any development, as this is the task of subcontractors. Even when I managed to build some products that I think were pretty cool, after just a few months the same products ended up forgotten into a drawer because were built with already outdated requirements (a management issue). 

Nowadays I just spend my days working on personal projects as the tasks that I'm assigned to are fairly easy and don't require me too much time. Plus, I'm working on stuff that I'm pretty sure nobody will ever use. Why do I know that? I could be literally gone for days and almost nobody would realize. I shouldn't really complain as I'm not working many hours and payed more than enough, but being constantly without motivation is definitely not good...

In the end I'd just like to be useful and to build something that I know will serve a purpose. Is it really hard to do that in big companies? Is there anyone in the same position as me?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/13y6m9f/does_working_in_a_large_corporation_ever_get_less/
"I'm a 'data analyst' who in practice is actually just a software engineer. Was I bamboozled, or did I misunderstand the role","my first job was as a consultant, doing a mix of implementation and data analytics. 

then i switched to a new job with the data analyst title, but I'm building production R scripts almost exclusively now; not a huge fan of wrangling with my team's complex/sparsely commented codebase and designing 'systems' (our scripts have to integrate with a variety of outside data sources).

I miss doing 'investigations', eg how do we better optimize this product, make more revenue, etc. now it feels like I'm an underpaid backend software engineer (making 85k but seems most SWEs are earning 100k+).

Discussion about the sub,"Hello, y'all. I've been wanting to address this question for some time now. The sub is slowly changing to r/learndatascience. We get the same questions posted here everyday (sometimes several times on the same day):

1. What degree should I get?
2. How much math should I learn to work with DS?
3. How can I get the first job?
4. Will IA replace DS jobs?
5. Now and then also there are the ""I don't like math, how can I work with DS"", or the ""do I really need to learn advanced math?"" where by advanced math people mean linear algebra and calculus.

I understand that these are honest questions, but they have been already asked billions of times. Also, it is kind of astounding how people want to work with a technical field, hence you need to be constantly learning things and searching for answers, and yet they don't even bother to search if the same question was already asked on the sub. I mean, this is not even hard to do, you don't even have to be on reddit, just post on google reddit + question and google will show the it.

In my opinion this is bad for the sub as an online forum. Compare, e.g., with stackexchange. If a question was already asked people will shut it as duplicate and link to the previous post where it was already answered. This is bad, imo, because, it floods the sub and prevents people from having good discussions about the topic of the sub. I mean, it is quite some time that I don't see a real DS post here.

I know that it can sound like a rant, but I understand r/datascience as a forum where people go to talk about DS and honestly I miss seeing these posts, e.g., people talking about how they solved some particular problem, talking about research papers and etc.

And last but not least, I know that DS was hyped and people think that it is the new ""dev"" job to get easy money. But I think that discuss this topic we would be better suited with a post just to address it.

“I would have benefited more with an MBA than a MS stats”,"This is a discussion I had with a relative of mine. She’s got her MS stats long ago and started working on modeling teams in various financial organizations, before she became one at a very reputable financial organization now. Soon, she said she got bored of building logistic regression models and moved to the analytics side, because she wanted to be more “business oriented”. She said that she liked it  more because it was more than just modeling, it was actually a leadership position.

When I asked her if her MS stats background was a valuable in asset in her analytics strategy role, she said that in fact, no it was the opposite, and she said she didn’t get respect from any higher ups for having a technical background. She feels she could have accelerated quicker due to an MBA, rather than a MS in statistics.

Is this something you guys are experiencing? Are there MBAs in data science now? Are MBAs really getting the nod nowadays in leadership roles? Even more so than good technical people? I’ve always had a negative opinion of MBAs, but, I’d like to hear from you all.



Edit: she runs a fraud analytics team for a major financial services company. My surprise is that she’s saying that for analytics, she feels an MBA could have moved her up the director chain faster.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/14f6g5p/i_would_have_benefited_more_with_an_mba_than_a_ms/
A Comparative Sentiment Analysis of Quran and Bible,"Abstract:  
This project presents a comparative sentiment analysis of the Quran and Bible, using a bag-of-words approach and the NRC lexicon. **It is important to note that the analysis conducted has no validity in a religious context, and it was not intended to make any statements or draw conclusions related to religions or controversial matters.** The objective of this project was to explore the sentiment distribution and identify commonalities in language usage between these texts.

Methodology:  
The project involved data preprocessing, including text cleaning and transformation into a bag-of-words representation. The NRC lexicon, a widely used sentiment lexicon, was employed to assign sentiment categories to the words. Due to the availability of English translations, the analysis was limited to the English versions of the texts.

&#x200B;

Flaws and Limitations:  
Two notable flaws should be acknowledged in this project. Firstly, the sentiment analysis was conducted on English translations of the Quran and Bible. This introduces a potential limitation, as nuances of sentiment expression in the original languages might not be fully captured. Further studies analyzing the sentiment of the texts in their original languages are warranted for a comprehensive analysis.

Additionally, the sizes of the Quran and Bible significantly differ, with the Bible being much larger. While this could introduce bias in sentiment distribution due to varying amounts of text, it is intriguing to note that despite this difference, the percentages of sentiments exhibited in both texts were remarkably similar. This observation highlights the potential universality of sentiment expression in religious texts, independent of their size or specific content.

Would you agree? Focusing on mastering math is the best RoI for long-term satisfaction,"First of all, this is from the perspective of an analyst who is more on the business side, so let me know if I'm completely stupid.

Why I'm writing this - I think many people underestimate the basic ""boring"" math and they just go right to how neural networks function or how to use logistic regression

Algorithms keep changing, libraries keep changing, domain related knowledge will (partially) change as your economy sector evolves and you'll pick it up as you go anyway...

Even whatever university degree you pick is kind of arbitrary, some of them might make learning math easier for you, but you can always pick it up yourself - even if you study something seemingly unrelated, if you're smart enough for data science you can self-study math

If you're worried about long-term job prospects and satisfaction, it seems to me you should focus on making your main goal to master all possible areas of math. Even the ones directly unrelated to your work. Because data science (and tech in general) is a lifelong study and you will keep having to learn new stuff all the time.

But if you know the fundamental math behind it all, it will make it much easier to learn new algorithms for example. It will also be easier to pick up the logic behind certain principles within your domain, as you'll get better intuition. Part of this should be learning logic (whether you count this as math or philosophy is up to debate).

I am just thinking out loud and kind of looking for confirmation bias, because I've been learning all the juicy ML algorithms and libraries, programming languages etc in the past few years. And I'm thinking I should have just focused on getting better at statistics, probability, combinatorics, discrete math in general... linear algebra... calculus... hell, even if you go all the way back to elementary school or high school, there are surely some topics you forgot and they might be useful to re-learn (like some stuff from geometry that you NEVER used but it could be the missing piece from understanding some stuff you're working on now).

Because all the stuff I learned a few years ago is already obsolete anyway. But math is unchanged for hundreds and thousands of years. And still useful.

So recently I've more shifted to the theoretical side of things. And it's made me happier with problem solving and I have less impostor syndrome. All kinds of different word problems are good practice especially.

tldr: Instead of learning 50 ways to do similar things, learning the underlying math - not superficially, but all the way to the fundamentals, even all the way to elementary school if you forgot something - should be better for long-term.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/1aq6sxh/would_you_agree_focusing_on_mastering_math_is_the/
I feel like I'm not good enough to find work,"

Got laid off a couple months ago because of a reorg in the company. I live in Georgia and I have 5 years of experience as business/data analyst.

"Should we use non-linear models for ""linear"" data?","So I had an argument with an interviewer who asked me why I didn't just use a non-linear classification model on the linearly separable data that I had in one of my projects that I described to him, even though I had no computational constraints. I told him that it was because, irrespective of computational cost, a linear model is always preferable if you have linear data because it is simpler and captures general pattern while non-linear models might overfit on  local patterns. But he kept disagreeing and saying that the only advantage that a linear model would have is computational cost and explainability even though I was actually getting better results with a logistic regression.

"Data science is not for me, is it?","I have 2.5 years of experience as a data scientist and have held two different positions. Prior to this, I was a PhD student in Physics, specializing in Cosmoloy. In my PhD, I truly enjoyed the programming part a lot. Developing codes, understanding the numerical methods, and see the final results that came out of my codes was very rewarding. I felt like a pro.

During my PhD I had a summer course about ML/DL and I enjoyed the mathematics behind it and that made me think that a job as data scientist would be a good choice.


However, I'm beginning to question if this was the right choice. I won't delve into the specifics of my job experiences, but in one role, I used CNNs to detect defects in images. Surprisingly, a simple pre-trained model with some fine-tuning proved sufficient, making the work less challenging than expected 😅. I left that position before deploying the model for monetary reasons.


In my current job, I've spent the last five months mainly engaging with stakeholders, without much technical work. We're still in the planning phase, figuring out how to collect and extract data from machines in a factory environment. Oftentimes, we encounter resistance from suppliers who are reluctant to share information. I'm starting to feel very dependent on external factors that I can't control.


I really miss coding and translating mathematical problems into programming solutions, which makes me wonder if a career in software engineering might be more suitable for me.

Lessons From my 2 Year Job Search,"I just wanted to share some insights from my lengthy job hunt that recently ended on a somewhat positive note. If this resonates with people, I might expand it into a Medium article. My aim is to discuss my experiences, help others, and encourage debate to refine these ideas. I've already applied these learnings to help friends land decent jobs, so I hope it helps you too. This is particularly aimed at those starting their careers in data.

A bit about me: I have 7 years of statistics education and a Master's from a reputable U.S. public school. Graduated amid COVID, I became a model & bottle promoter in Europe while freelancing as a data scientist/analyst. Landed a corperate Data Analyst role last month.

1: Experience Over Education

Your education should solely be a stepping stone to gain experience, be it through internships, entry-level positions, or research. Don't overestimate the power of theoretical knowledge; practical experience reigns supreme. Grades only serve as a ticket to initial experiences.

2 and 3: Refer to Point 1

4: Understanding HR/Recruiters

When writing your resume or preparing for interviews, keep it simple but impactful. Recruiters skim through resumes, so your accomplishments should stand out and be quantifiable. Misrepresenting numbers isn't advisable but emphasizing impact is.

5: Always Be Active

If you're job-hunting, always have a project in the works. Freelance gigs are relatively easy to find, and they add valuable experience to your resume. Keep records of your work—publish articles, maintain a GitHub repository, or hold onto contracts.

6: Networking and Luck

Networking is crucial, and often it's not about what you know but who you know. Being at the right place at the right time can spell success. Lack of social skills will be a bottleneck to career growth even when technical skills are stellar.

7: Company Culture vs Reality

Companies may claim to value innovation and talent, but what they're really looking for are reliable candidates who won't mess up. They're impressed by practical business experience, not academic projects or grades. Phrases like ""innovative culture"", ""entrepreneurial"",  ""solving the largest problems"", ""looking for the most talented people"", etc. are all lies especially for starting out.

8: Avoid Targeting Remote Jobs

Targeting only remote jobs was my biggest mistake. Remote positions usually require a significant amount of experience, so aim for local opportunities or consider relocating.

Final Words
Always prioritize your needs over the company's. Don't shy away from promoting yourself or taking new offers even at the last minute. Most companies are self-centered, and as an employee, you should adopt the same approach to your advantage.

Hope this helps, and I'd love to hear your thoughts!",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/170jlh2/lessons_from_my_2_year_job_search/

The future of coding in data analytics,"Like a lot of people who studied data science, i spend a lot more of my career looking at analytics, reporting and visualisation these days - lets face it, thats where the bulk of the value and jobs are in most industries.

I spend my first few years working in teams that used R (mostly) or Python. And SQL, obviously. Basically understanding and investigating stuff was done in SQL, visualisation, dashboards, packs were done in R (shout out to ggplot2).

I now work in consulting, where i get to see a lot of industry analytics teams and a lot of the analytics teams i work with these days are ""no code"" teams.

These teams use click and drag tools for ETL, analytics, visualisation and reporting (qlikview, dataiku, power bi, sas EG, alteryx, informatica). There are entire analytics and even engineering functionalities within some companies where noone can code.

Now these tools are expensive as hell - but they are time efficient, reduce a lot of IT risk around data access, and limit the amount of fuckery a single rogue idiot can wreak.

My question is, as these tools become more entrenched in major organisations is there any role for analysts that can code?

To be honest, im biased - i love coding, so i want to believe there is a future for it. But also dont want to bury my head in the sand either, if coding is going the way of the typewriter.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/17zgu1a/the_future_of_coding_in_data_analytics/

This is not a rant. Im looking for advice because I feel pretty lost. I honestly dont feel like going back to my field because I dont have it in me. But I cant stay jobless forever. Im having a mental breakdown accepting I may not get into DS so soon because Ive made so many projections about future me as a data guy.

Data science is overspecialized (or me underspecialized)?,"I'm currently a data scientist working in financial industry. I'm self-taught, don't have master's/PhD in stats/math (have master's in unrelated filed, doesn't help me with DS). İn my job market, unfortunately, most data scientists are self-taught or bootcamp graduates, so, employers don't require degrees really. But, the lack of formal relevant education really makes me doubtful, insecure and frustrated actually about my future. As I'd like to work remotely or relocate (to Europe), I'm feeling really insecure. DS in US/EU seems very overspecialized, with everyone in the industry having PhDs, being wizards of stats, etc. In this subreddit I've also seen a lot of people talking about the need of solid math/stats foundation, or just forget about DS. 

Is it true? Do I need to spend 1-2 years figuring out math/stats on my own somehow (still without degree) to get a decent job? It feels quiete overwhelming and hard to be honest. I really love technical part of the job (coding in general, deployment, building pipelines, etc), but the theoretical part really haunts me. Should I look for something more software related like data/mlops engineering instead? I'm really feeling overwhelmed and lost here, any advice would be great.

P.S. I'm not talking about working in FAANG-level companies, I'd like to have a decent DS job with adequate pay, not $300k+shares type of stuff.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/139h17o/data_science_is_overspecialized_or_me/
Should I accept this data science job (i.e. how bad is the job market?),"I'm a master's student rn, graduating next year and just got a return offer from the internship I did this summer. It was a cool place and I liked the people, but their salary offer isn't great - $68,000 in a high CoL city (Washington DC area). It does come with good benefits which is nice, and I've been told it's very likely my pay would go up to at least $90,000 after two years, with potential for higher. 

Should I accept given the current state of the job market? Or should I decline and search for a higher-paying opportunity later? Financially, I believe I could make $68,000 work, but it would be tough with student loan debt and DC rent. DC is also a considerable distance from my family and not ideally where I'd want to settle, although I generally like the area. The position does not allow WFH either which is a downside.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/16qaxeq/should_i_accept_this_data_science_job_ie_how_bad/
Best way to defer on a question I don't know in an interview?,"So, I'm an experienced data scientist but my current job of seven years wasn't particularly stats or ML intensive. I'm a wiz when it comes to data acquisition/wrangling/visualization but my last gig that really involved stats and modeling was quite a few years ago at this point. And unfortunately said job is coming to an end and I'm on the market for a new gig. 

I have a second round interview coming up and I'm worried about getting hit with a technical question I don't know the answer to. I'm giving myself a crash refresher with a data science interview book but I still think there's a non-trivial chance of getting hit with a technical question I just don't know. I'm wondering if anyone has suggestions on what to say or how to handle that scenario in a way that maximizes my chances of not scuttling the interview entirely.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/13tm7t7/best_way_to_defer_on_a_question_i_dont_know_in_an/
Reflecting on the Changing Hiring Bar,"I'm curious to hear your experiences on how the hiring bar has changed, especially for those that have been in the field 5+ years.

From a purely anecdotal perspective, it feels that the hiring bar for data scientists has gone up and is all over the place. I might be wrong, but it felt that 5 years ago if you knew A/B testing + jupyter notebooks it was good enough.

Disclaimer: there's no one definitive definition of what a data scientist is, so each company/field will have different criteria. Obviously you can't thoroughly test for everything, sometimes it's just a ""Can you tell me what X is and how it's used?"".

These are the interview elements where I feel the bar has gone up:

* More leetcode medium, DS/ML coding level is moving closer to SWE. Definitely ran into some leetcode hards. 
* MLE leaning roles will ask for knowledge on how to productize DS projects. Knowledge of AWS and containers is sort of expected.
* DS roles expect at least some idea of how neural networks work, sometimes how transformers work.

What has not changed and will probably remain the same:

* SQL still very relevant, not much change in difficulty.
* Classification metrics.
* Ability to translate business problems into DS action items.
* Hypothesis testing.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/12l8o0k/reflecting_on_the_changing_hiring_bar/

"Learning Python and R at the same time - Pros and Cons, and Do's and Don'ts","EDIT: Thank you for all the amazing insights so far!

Hi all,

The question is for those who have experience with this. I like to have one as a main language and the other as the sidekick. For now I seem to have chosen for Python for several reasons, more courses and tutorials, more articles, larger community. However, R and by extension RStudio/Posit, somehow has a huge attraction to me. Maybe it's their lively Youtube channel, great looking website, ... they just seem to be out there.

I installed both, tried both, chose Python as my main focus. At least once a week RStudio is calling me so I launch it and click around (I like Quarto too btw). But the more I learn Python, the more I find R code to be weird.

In the end I just need to try learning both to find out if it's going to work out, but I like to ask the community first so I can start from a sort of baseline on those with experience in learning them at the same time.

What are the pros and cons, do's and don'ts? Did you basically do everything twice, once in Py and once in R? Or use them for different things, perhaps EDA in R, but then move to Py for ML (or vice versa)? Would that be a good way to learn both, or even make it more complicated?

A bit of background info, I'm learning this in my spare time, neither is used at my current job. Looking at job descriptions on my side of the world, the most asked of the two is Python, some ask for R, some ask for R as a second, and a few stated that either is fine. To me learning a second has merit and potential purpose.

Data scientists knowing what data engineers do,"How many data scientists know the ins and outs of what data engineers do? Just curious what your level of understanding or perception is.

Why employers want experience over education,"**Creativity**: We often focus a lot on hard skills, but creativity is the most important attribute for a data scientist. You will get some crazy requests. For example, I was once asked to build a recommendation system with NO DATA. Many other data scientists dismissed the project saying it couldn't be done. I was able to accomplish it by building a simple model were I manually entered weights depending on how important I thought each feature was. I then set up a pipeline to update these weights as real data would come in. Was it perfect? No. But it did a good enough job while we were waiting for data and made the client happy. I have had many crazy requests like this. So many data scientists out there have to be told what to do, very few can come up with creative solutions. The best never use phrases like, ""that is impossible."" How do you learn this creativity? By working on real world problems. This skill is not developed when you are given a toy dataset and told what the output should look like. Sure, you might learn some technical modeling, but virtually no creativity. I wish more bootcamps would give ""impossible"" tasks.

**Dirty Data**: I understand that provided or toy datasets can sometimes be dirty. They don't come close to real world data. Imagine you are asked to build a model using datasets you do not know exist yet, coming from source systems with little-to-no descriptions of what the features mean. Somehow you need to find the right data in a sea of millions of irrelevant features. You will need to fight political battles to even get access to the features you do not yet know if you even need. You will need to track down knowledgeable people who can tell you the weird quirks in the data (e.g. missing months were poorly imputed when this random country suffered a natural disaster 12 years ago). You then need to build a full pipeline that pulls the data from 10 different data sources that don't link to each other naturally, do regression tests because they don't update consistently, transform it, do feature engineering, feed it to a model, monitor the model for drift, redo everything after you find out a feature is completely different from what you were told, and the list goes on. This is not an exaggeration, it is typical. It goes way beyond cleaning up a few outliers and training a prototype model. This experience can only be gained by doing it.

**Being easy to work with**: A bad hire can be a disaster! One person can ruin group moral and be difficult to get rid of. It can be difficult to judge personality from a few interviews. Haveing work experience where you got along with the same team for years greatly reduces that risk.

There are many others, but these are three big ones. If you don't have these skillsets, that is fine! But you have to start smaller. Get a more Jr level position where you are not expected to know all of these. Get experience working on them with more senior mentors.

Planning to quit,"When I joined one of the big 4,  8 months ago I thought it would be a good role in a data science position but soon realized the quality of analytics is low and I was doing better before. But salary was 23% higher so I took it. I am getting bored with no real data science work. What are my chances to go back to industry as a principal data scientist or lead statistician? 

I know the market is bad right now but I have over19 years of analytics experience so I am thinking to switch. Biggest worry is being able to convince the new employer why I am moving so quickly.

Support vector machines dominate my prediction modeling nearly every time,"Whenever I build a stacking ensemble (be it for classification or regression), a support vector machine nearly always has the lowest error. Quite often, its error will even be lower or equivalent to the entire ensemble with averaged predictions from various models (LDA, GLMs, trees/random forests, KNN, splines, etc.). Yet, I rarely see SMVs used by other people. Is this just because you strip away interpretation for prediction accuracy in SMVs?

Is imposter syndrome in data analytics/science common?,"I’m [M27] currently a Senior Data Analyst in the public sector in the UK. My background was a Physics degree, Physics PhD (involving data analysis), a 2 year stint as a Junior Data Analyst after that, and I recently landed my Senior role.

Despite it going very well for me on paper (and in practice - I have never had any performance concerns raised, and have been praised for my work) I constantly feel like I’m not good enough. It feels like there’s always just *too much* to know and remember, whether it be different programming languages or mathematical/statistical approaches. You’ve got programming languages like SQL, R, Python, tools like Excel and Power BI, version control platforms like GitHub, and that’s before you get into the world of statistics and statistical techniques (descriptive stats, inferential stats, predictive modelling, etc.), and data visualisation. And this is even before you have to get to grips with the datasets you’re working with and the wider context.

The problem is, it just seems impossible to know and retain all this information, especially when I’m not using it all daily - yet I put this pressure on myself to be a fountain of knowledge for all things data analysis because you’re supposed to “gain experience and develop” throughout your career. So why do I feel like I’m actively getting worse and forgetting things every day? I basically feel like “me of yesterday” was sharper/cleverer than the “me of today”.

Are these normal thoughts? 

Part of me wonders if it’s due to my background being physics (also forgotten most of that now despite doing 7 years of it), and not directly statistics, or do people in other technical fields with relevant backgrounds have these thoughts too?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/18z0sbu/is_imposter_syndrome_in_data_analyticsscience/
ChatGPT becomes a serious contender for exploratory data analysis,"You likely heard about the recent ChatGPT updates with the possibility to create assistants (aka GPTs) with code generation and interpretation capacities. One of the GPTs provided with this update by OpenAI is a Data Analysis assistant, showing the company already identified this area as a strong application for its tech.

Just by providing a dataset you can start generating some simple or more advanced visualisations, including those needing some data processing or aggregations. This means anyone can interact with a dataset just using plain English.

If you're curious (and have a ChatGPT+ subscription) you can play with this [GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-5CQsMRvyT-international-football-explorer) I created to explore a dataset on International Football Games (aka soccer ;) ).

What makes it strong:

* Interact in simple English, no coding required
* Long context: you can iterate on a plot or analysis as chatGPT keeps memory of the past context
* Capacity to generate plots or run some data processing thanks to its capacity to write and execute Python code.
* You can use ChatGPT's ""knowledge"" to comment on what you observe and give you some hints on trends you observe

I'm personally quite impressed, the results are most of the time correct (you can check the code it generated). Provided the tech was only released a year ago, this is very promising and I can easily imagine such natural language interface being implemented in traditional BI platforms like Tableau or Looker.

It is of course not perfect and we should be cautious when using it. Here are some caveats:

* It struggles with more advanced requests like creating a model. It usually needs mulitple iteration and some technical guidance (e.g. indicating which model to choose) to get to a reasonable result.
* It can make some mistakes that you won't catch unless you have a good understanding of the dataset or check the code (e.g. at some point it ran an analysis on a subset that it generated for a previous analysis while I wanted to run it on the whole dataset). You need to be extra careful with the instructions you give it and double checking the results
* You need to manually upload the datasets for now, which makes non-technical persons still dependent on someone to pull the data for them. Integration with external databases or external apps connected to multiple APIs will soon come to fix that, it is only an integration issue.

It will definitely not take our jobs tomorrow but it will make business stakeholders less reliant on technical persons and might slightly reduce the need for data analysts (the same way tools like Midjourney reduce a bit the dependence on artists for some specific tasks, or ChatGPT for Copywriters).

Below are some examples of how you can easily require for a plot to be created with a first interpretation.

Red flags include:

* No data / inaccessible data / data flying around in Excel
* Management is not ""ML literate""
* More work dealing with red tape than actual work
* 2x more managers than workers driving projects
* Business consumers of our ML output do not trust it, and do not want it. They only like linear regression because they understand it
* No version control. We run everything manually in prod. There is no dev/qa/prod separation. There is no deployment. There is no automation.
* Because we work directly in prod, we don't have permission to save our processed data to tables or csv's - it must be done in memory every single day
* No access to basic tools of the trade. We had to beg for basic file storage (s3) for 9 weeks. We can't download unapproved libraries or pre-trained models without security review (even just for exploration)

Haven't had any real work for the last 2 years at 2 different companies,"I graduated May 2021 and started working as a Data Scientist at General Motors. I was given a project but there was no project manager, customer, deadline or anything. I held myself accountable for 5 months setting my own deadlines etc until I realized that this just wasn't a real project and the company was terribly mismanaged. I took initiative to find other projects and each project I got just kept getting canceled or there wasn't any data.

Then I switched to a Solutions Data Scientist role July 2022 at a larger tech company last year. I spent the first 3 months in training (completely irrelevant to Data Science) and then had absolutely no work. I networked like crazy and got a project on another team last fall which was somewhat exciting but this year there has been absolutely nothing. The other teams seem to have work but they won't let me on to even shadow because they want to prioritize utilization for their employees. My team has no data science work or data to play with. The Solutions Data Scientist role is weird because it is client-facing so if the clients don't want to engage, there is no work. Another challenge is that even when the clients engage, our priority is selling the company's AI products so there is minimal actual data science involved.

I'm kind of concerned that I'm going to end up with years of Data Science experience with nothing to show for it. What should I do? If I applied for Data Science at another company now, it would be hard given the recessionary environment and the fact that I've probably gotten pretty technically soft now.

Is this the reality with Data Science roles? Is it like a fake job? I'm wondering if I should move to a different role, like Product Management, where I might be guaranteed a steady flow of work to do.

Now what I am concerned about is that I start to write my dissertation on something which builds on the state of the art but will eventually become completely irrelevant after a year or two because the state of the art has progressed massively and achieves better results than my approach could ever imagine. I imagine it to be frustrating to still having to finish something which won’t really provide any scientific value. 

Do I think a too one-dimensional or is this a valid consideration?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/18ktx2o/does_a_phd_thesis_in_machine_learning_even_make/
Took me over a year but I finally got a data analyst job,"Graduated summer of 2022 with a MS in Analytics after discovering the field by accident while exploring possible new fields, as I got burnt out from crazy hours at a previous database engineer role. I kept getting far in interview processes but never the role, although in hindsight I dropped out of a few interview processes that I maybe shouldn't have since I'd be the only analyst in the company. Finally got one this week, albeit as a data engineer/analyst supporting another analyst, right after taking a customer service role as I was giving up and planning on going to grad school next year for something completely different.

Is LeetCode style coding essential for Data Science?,"Don't get me wrong - I totally understand that a good data scientist cannot escape from coding. But in my two years of experience as a data scientist, I'd been surviving on just importing and using ready-made python packages like pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow and so on. Most of my energy and efforts were spent on trying to understand statistical tests, how the models work, their underlying assumptions or how data can be processed.

All of a sudden now, I will need to go through a LeetCode style coding test to continue staying on as a data scientist. And apparently, such tests are not uncommon within data science interviews in many places? Before I had to prepare for this coding test, I don't even know what is a Linked List, Tree data structure, dynamic programming or greedy algorithms. Even now, I still don't see how being proficient in data structure and algorithm concepts will help me become a better data scientist (given that I've already survived two years without knowing such concepts, or can work on kaggle projects without ever invoking Linked List or Binary Tree).

So help me understand - how are CS concepts essential for doing data science? There are so many skills demanded of a data scientist.

Twitter's For You Recommendation Algorithm,"Twitter open-sourcing a majority of its recommendation algorithm offers an exciting opportunity for researchers, industry practitioners, and RecSys enthusiasts to closely examine how Twitter computes the recommended feed for the For You page.

[Twitter's announcement](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2023/a-new-era-of-transparency-for-twitter) | [Main GitHub Repo](https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm/) | [ML GitHub Repo](https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm-ml) | [Engineering Blog Post](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/open-source/2023/twitter-recommendation-algorithm)

TL;DR:

**Candidate Generation**

* For You Feed has an equal split for in-network tweets and out-of-network tweets.
* In-network tweets are sourced using a logistic regression on features derived from Twitter's RealGraph framework (batch-updated daily).
   *  Twitter also mentioned that the logistic regression model was trained several years ago and is being redesigned. 
* Some out-of-network tweets are sourced from 2 types of random walks over a real-time, in-memory, bipartite graph based on the GraphJet engine. While the majority is sourced from SimClusters in latent embedding space.
* Pretrained Heterogeneous Information Network (TwHIN) embeddings are used for multiple downstream tasks including candidate generation and ranking.

**Ranking**

* Early ranking is done in EarlyBird using a logistic regression model.
   * Twitter notes that “*the current model was last trained several years ago, and uses some very strange features.*” and they are working on training a new model. 
* A Parallel MaskNet (originally proposed by Weibo) is used as the heavy ranker.

**Heuristics and Filtering**

* Out-of-network competitor URLs and out-of-network tweets without second-degree connection are removed.
* Blue verified accounts are boosted by a factor of 2 or 4 (out-of-network vs in-network).

**Mixing**

* Ads, promotions, and follow recommendations are blended into the feed.

Twitter also released a lot of artifacts like the associated code, model configs, hyperparameters, input feature descriptions, feature weights, combined score calculation formulas, etc. that are immensely valuable for ML practitioners.

How do you avoid p-hacking?,"We've set up a Pre-Post Test model using the [Causal Impact](https://google.github.io/CausalImpact/CausalImpact.html) package in R, which basically works like this:

* The user feeds it a target and covariates
* The model uses the covariates to predict the target
* It uses the residuals in the post-test period to measure the effect of the change

Great -- except that I'm coming to a challenge I have again and again with statistical models, which is that tiny changes to the model completely change the results.

We are training the models on earlier data and checking the RMSE to ensure goodness of fit before using it on the actual test data, but I can use two models with near-identical RMSEs and have one test be positive and the other be negative.

The conventional wisdom I've always been told was not to peek at your data and not to tweak it once you've run the test, but that feels incorrect to me. My instinct is that, if you tweak your model slightly and get a different result, it's a good indicator that your results are not reproducible.

So I'm curious how other people handle this. I've been considering setting up the model to identify 5 settings with low RMSEs, run them all, and check for consistency of results, but that might be a bit drastic.

Moving from a SQL Monkey role into an ML Engineering role,"I know, I know, this sub thinks of getting into a well-paid SQL monkey role as winning a lottery.

My problem is that the higher-ups saw me as the most talented SQL monkey on the team, and ""promoted"" me into a team lead role where I now have to manage 10 other SQL monkeys, and regularly interact with lots of unpleasant people in the company. I have lasted for a couple of years but honestly I just can't take it anymore. Way too much stress and way too little technical challenge.

So I've made up my mind to leave, but I figured the chances of me finding another SQL monkey job that would pay as well are pretty slim (I'm in Europe). Everyone is saying the real money is in Engineering.

**Has anyone ever made a successful transition from a SQL monkey role into an ML engineering role? Can you give me any advice on what to prepare for, what to watch out for, and how to best sell myself?**

My biggest concern is that after 2 years of being a SQL monkey - followed by 2 years of managing other SQL monkeys - I have very little to show. I haven't shipped a single ML model to prod in the last 5 years, and I have no idea where I'd even start in a ML system design interview because... well, my company didn't give me a single opportunity to design ML systems at scale.

At the same time I don't think I am a Junior engineer - my Python / ML fundamentals are still strong,  and after two years in management I think it's fair to say I have very solid soft / leadership skills too. I just don't want to stay on the management track anymore.

Do I stand a chance getting into ML engineering roles in the current market?

Is it wrong to be wanting to stay mediocre?,"I am just over 1 year into my role as a Data Analyst.

Due to my inexperience, I am usually working on some of the more mundane and boring tasks. I did try to go above and beyond, and took on tasks that became extra learning for me. These types of works took me weeks to go through. Not only was my effort not appreciated other than the usual ""Thanks!"" or ""Great work!"", it sometimes didn't even make it to the final modeling.

There are also times when the database gets a hiccup and takes days for admins to fix it, times when the raw data doesn't have all the info we're looking for, or things that are just beyond my control. I feel so frustrated with these type of problems because I really can't do anything about it other than keep saying ""Waiting for the the issue to be resolved"" on the team update.

I really was looking forward to using this job as an opportunity to sharpen my skills in data professionalism, but I don't see the merit. It also doesn't help the fact that most of the work I do is global health-related topics, something that I came to not care about.

Maybe I am just working for the wrong industry, but I don't think I care if I don't get a promotion and pay increase; If I am not enjoying my work on top of my work not being appreciated, I just don't see any reason to try harder.

EDIT:

Thanks for the responses. It made me think about what I want to be doing in the near future. I do like the work I’m doing, but maybe I am just not in the right industry? I also feel the exact nature of my work is somewhat different from what is typically expected in a DA role.

I don’t mind having lots to do, but I want see progress made. If I’m stuck on things that are beyond my control, I start to feel disdain in what I’m doing.

I will be starting a master’s program soon that will help me strengthen my skills. With it I’m hoping to be DA for other industries because i will have a few years of experience by then.

I also feel like my work is actually useful and makes a difference for the university since it gets used in institution-wide decision making, accreditation, gets published on the website, etc.

I love that they don't care ""when"" I work as long as the work gets done (i.e., I can run errands mid morning if I feel like it, etc.) - there's a ton of freedom/autonomy. And I love statistics/numbers, and I feel like I get to be somewhat creative. I will say, however, I'm in lots of Zoom meetings that should maybe be emails lol, but it's sometimes nice just to get a chance to talk to people since we're remote (I kind of feel like that's what the meetings are for).

Finally, the pay and benefits are amazing. A lot of the time, I'm amazed by it lol (particularly since I came from a lower-paying, higher-workload and higher-stress field - clinical research - it's night and day).

So, how did I get into it? I'm doing my master's in DS and have a bachelor's degree in econometrics, but I also think the bulk of how I got the job was from doing projects and being able to show that I knew what I was doing via a portfolio/giving concrete examples of competency. (I mostly used Python/R, SQL, and Tableau. Also Jupyter notebooks, and Excel and PowerPoint are probably good to know, etc.)",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/18ylba9/update_half_a_year_into_my_first_data_science_job/
Why should I learn OOP?,"Hi there,

I’d rank myself as intermediate-senior data scientist and I’ve never had to learn object oriented programming since functional approach worked most of the time.

Change my mind: AI is inherently public domain knowledge and should not be commercialized,"So I want to start out by saying that AI is an incredibly useful, arguably fundamental tool.  LLMs have an amazing potential to aid in productivity, I really feel that AI is going to make personalized healthcare a possibility and there are of course many as of yet undiscovered applications.  We need AI in our lives and it can make the world a better place.

But the scale of data required to train these things necessitates using publicly available data which no one can claim to have developed or collected themselves.  If a company has sales data and it trains AI on that data which they colected and organized, then yes they can claim this is an IP they themselves made and developed.  But we all know these models are of limited generalizability.  And when we think of training say an AI to predict which drug is going to treat a person cancer based on the genotyping of a tumor sample there is simply no way an private enterprise would be able to collect and collate the data needed for that sort of discovery.  It needs to be open access, you can commercialize certain aspects and applications I'm sure.  Like compounds discovered using the model, if you used it to develop those compounds.  But the core model needs to be not for profit and withholding that model past a certain point is harmful to society at large and unjust considering you didn't really build the thing yourself.

Looking forward to counter arguments, refinement of my logic, and healthy discussion.  Be civil lets have a fun talk if you have any thoughts!

**EDIT** ***I wanted to share something a very knowledgeable poster provided about what specific aspects of an LLM (or other advance ML) should be public and what should remain a companies IP.  It's very comprehensive and well thought through:***

>I think the entire set of training data (technically I mean the entire dataset and not in the sense of training, validation, test, or any other subset used for calibration) should be made available, even what is created in-house. I think it's very important that everyone at least have the same access to the data. My reasoning for that is because it is extremely important to ensure that dataset is not biased, which would take a lot of people with a lot of different perspectives to figure out. It also removes the major barrier to entry so hopefully people would focus on innovation, instead of obtaining data. That's it though. Everything else is the spawn of creativity and compute resources and opening them would serve no purpose beyond allowing replication of the product.  
>  
>The parameter weights are the product of the compute time, so once that expense gets high enough, IMO, it really seems like theft to force them to give it away. It would remove the incentive for anyone else to spend more time making a better product. The structure of the models, the order the functions are called, even the way the training data is applied can all make a big difference in performance. So I see that as a creative work requiring a lot of effort which also shouldn't be given away. If the models are only using techniques developed in academia, then anyone can learn those regardless of whether or not any specific company makes their models public (spoiler: they aren't).  
>  
>I would also be supportive of making it a requirement to provide no-cost API access for watchdogs or organizations to ensure an unbiased final model. Like an audit of the final product.

"Working as a Data Scientist, what can I do to not lose my software engineering skills?","Hello. I'm data professional with one and half year experience who spent 5 years working as a software engineer before that. At first my work in data was mostly MLE, so I used to make a lot of coding 

However in the last 6 months I realized I'm no longer doing any engineering job and now mostly create queries and some data pipelines with Spark and most of my work is data analysis, statistical testing and modeling. Also spend a lot of time discussing with business team and designers to try to figure out how to turn my insights in new features 

I do like my job and I don't see myself coming back to engineering for at least more 2 years. 

However I'm afraid I can lose some of my software engineering skills because I no longer code proper software, only small bits of data. It's scripting more than engineering and I fear in future I might struggle to come back to engineering if I decide I don't want to progress further in my Data career

Has anybody played with Astrological sign as a feature?,"Now that I've got your attention.

Astrology, while largely a pseudoscience that appeals to non data minded folk, is largely about identifying trends and presenting them in a human readable (albeit unscientific) format.

While it's unlikely that the placement of the stars and planets themselves have a significant impact on the trajectory of an individual, the placing of their birthdate within the year (which I suppose is in relation to the sun) probably has an impact on how they develop and find their way within society.

For example, someone born in August tends to start school almost a year earlier in their development than an individual born in September. From there the August child will always be amongst the youngest in their class whereas the September child is grouped with the oldest. This has cascading effects throughout childhood development that will leave drastically different imprints upon both children and create different adult life paths.

So now that I've gone through that long winded explanation to justify my buzzy title, does anybody have experience playing with birthdate (specifically time of year, as opposed to age) as a feature?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/1ahj1gj/has_anybody_played_with_astrological_sign_as_a/

Off my chest: No need for costly masters,"Sorry if this is odd to post here - I completed 11 out of 12 courses for my MSDS at Northwestern and just felt like the program was extremely lackluster. The required courses in management rather than the technicals. It was 55k and it would have been obvious to transfer quickly to OMSA or the newer programs.The landscape looked different when I was applying for programs, and I was initially skeptical of entirely MOOC based programs. However, I ended up just watching YT videos as my lectures anyway.

I would just like to warn others when deciding whether or not to go back to school. I’m still taking time to patch up on knowledge that I felt like I did not gain via the program. Although with that being said, that would be the case with any masters program. I am almost considering not even doing the last capstone just because I know that there are other things that I would rather learn.

I literally just have the capstone left but I am almost considering just letting it go

Which path is better: Data Science or Software Engineering?,"Okay, so I'm in need of some career advice, because honestly I'm at a point where I don't really know how to proceed in the future.

For some background info:
- I've completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (3 years degree), took a year of pause (during that time I just focused on work), and at the moment I'm in my first year (out of 2) of my Masters's degree in Data Science.

- As for work experience, I started working during my second year of Bachelor's as a Software Engineer. I've completed two internships, and I've been a Junior Software Engineer for more than a year and a half (currently I'm still working, trying to manage both my job and the university lectures and assignments in parallel). The languages/frameworks that I've worked with the most are Python - Django/FatsAPI, Ruby - Ruby on Rails, TypeScript - React (even if my perspective for this field is that I shouldn't be fixed on just some languages/standards, as the industry is evolving at such a rate, that from a month to the other we might find a new tool that's 100 times more efficient).

- Up until recently I didn't ever interact that much with the concepts of Machine Learning, but since starting the Data Science degree I've realised that I like this field a lot and I take every Uni project as a challenge that I love solving.

Now let's get to the actual issue at hand: in the next few months I would like to look for another workplace, since I've realized that the environment that I'm currently in is affecting me negatively and unfortunately I don't consider that this is a place where I can grow (both as an employee/software engineer as well as a person in general). If you'd like more info about the reasons, I can edit this post and add them, but I don't want to make this too long.

At this point, I don't really know what path to take: continue with the Software Engineering career or switch to Data Science / ML / NLP?

I'm asking this from 2 distinct perspectives:
1. which one of the two is better for my future? I've been reading different posts lately about some data scientists / ml engineers saying that this field is really volatile and a lot of companies switch strategies from one day to another and many find themselves unemployed out of the blue, besides the fact that some people say that there are already too many data scientists / ml engineers for the few jobs required. But thinking about all of the advances in AI that have been happening lately, I was under the impression that this field is going to thrive in the future.
2. I have always believed that salaries in both fields are good, but as a data scientist / ml engineer you can reach a higher max salary compared to what the max salary of a software engineer can be (even if I've also read posts that stated the contrary).

If I want to be completely honest, I think that I already have the answer, since I like a lot what I'm studying and everything related to this field is just sooo captivating. 

But my problem right now is that I've ve been able to get to a point where I'm competent enough as a software engineer to make enough money to support myself, so finding another job in the same field would be easier. Since my parents are not helping me financially anymore, I don't think I would be able to get by with the paycheck of an intern (around 800 Euros/month where I live), if I were to switch fields.
And I don't think anyone would take me in this field for anything more than an internship, because I'm aware of the fact that I do not have enough experience in Machine Learning and Statistics for any other role.

As for some additional information that might be helpful, I'm in my early twenties and I live in Eastern Europe, where prices are not as high as in other places, but it's still not easy to get by by yourself.
I've been also looking around for various opportunities in other countries in this field, in order to be able to work remotely or maybe do an internship there, but I haven't been able to find much.

PS: I know that a lot of people might say that I'm young and that this is the best time to take risks, but going to an intern's salary would just expose me to the risk of being homeless, and that's not such a good option :D

PS 2.0: I have also mentioned the NLP sector because it sparked my interest and I’ve been taking some extra classes in order to gain some more knowledge about it.

How do data scientist managers manage data scientists?,"As a data science manager how do you manage your team? Specifically how do you manage your DSs career growth and promotion opportunities? Imagine you have a team of 5 DSs: 2 DS1, 2 DS2, and 1 DS3, where DSX is a Data Scientist 1-4. What is your measure of success - promotions, completed projects, revenue contribution,etc? How do DSX become DSX+1?

Some of my thoughts:

1. As a manager, I can support my DSs by **NOT** micromanaging.  I will track your project and encourage model reviews, code reviews and present final outputs to the team. All necessary skills of a DS.

2. I can ensure my DSs have the skills to mange a project. A DS1 would see many touch points with the manager(me) or a DS3-4 on projects to ensure success, a DS2 less, and DS3 probably none. This in fact is my basis for promotion - shows level of competency on managing projects and deliverables. 

3. There can also be project based performance promotion, that is, DS possibly lacking project managing skills but tackles difficult projects and delivers top notch work consistently. 

4. The bigger issue is about personal development(PD).  How do managers balance PD against available projects? The DSs may want to gain experience in applying AI or unstructured learning , GPGPU models, specific toolsets like Vertex AI, NLP etc. Your team’s project assignments  may not see this diverse a set of projects. When a project becomes available I balance availability against skill set in order to complete the projects based on delivery times and quarterly goals because these are the measures of success for my team. Typically I fill the void with targeted training courses and allocate time to PD. 

5. Some managers think PD is solely the DS’s responsibility. Thoughts?

6. How do you deal with HR when there are no clear DS role descriptions?

Background story: This semester I'm taking a machine learning class and noticed some aspects of the course were a bit odd.

1. Roughly a third of the class is about logic-based AI, problog, and some niche techniques that are either seldom used or just outright outdated.
2. The teacher made a lot of bold assumptions (not taking into account potential distribution shifts, assuming computational resources are for free \[e.g. **Leave One Out Cross-Validation**\])
3. There was no mention of MLOps or what actually matters for machine learning in production.
4. Deep Learning models were outdated and presented as if though they were SOTA.
5. A lot of evaluation methods or techniques seem to make sense within a research or academic setting but are rather hard to use in the real world or are seldom asked by stakeholders.

(This is a biased opinion based off of 4 internships at various companies)

This is just one class but I'm just wondering if it's common for professors to have a biased opinion while teaching (favouring academic techniques and topics rather than what would be done in the industry)

I thought the only reason why people put up with it was because it was easily accessible, but to learn that it’s actually super expensive just makes me wonder why so many people still use it.  

For me personally, SAS is a huge pain in the ass when it comes to data manipulation. I don’t like not being able to see the result of coding as I go along, like I would in R or even Python. Not to mention, it doesn’t run on Mac systems, and their free university software (that I’ve been using) does not allow you to copy and paste. It also automatically logs you out after 15 mins of nothingness, WITHOUT AUTOSAVING, which is incredibly stressful. I do love running multivariate categorical analyses in SAS though.

How do you deal with people wanting definite answers when statistics isn't deterministic?,"I'm sure you all know that nothing in statistics is certain, it's all probabilities and degrees of confidence. Well, I'm finding business people simply just don't comprehend that. The amount of times I've had to explain that correlation =/= causation, or why aggregate metrics based on very small sample sizes aren't reliable is insane. Like I get it's not their job to know stats and data science, but at some point these things should be common sense, and I shouldn't have to waste half a meeting explaining it for the 30th time.

And whenever I come back to them with some kind of result, I choose my words carefully, not to over promise, cause guess who's ass is on the line if I'm wrong. If I say ""increased advertising appears to be correlated with increased sales"", they hear ""spend more money on advertising"". They will then spend that money and if it doesn't work, I'm the one who apparently messed up.

I've been working around it by both choosing my words carefully and creating documentation. Kind of like a CYA, if they don't heed my warnings and it blows up in their faces, at least I can point back to them saying I told them. For the former, it's in one ear out the other, are increasingly happening in meetings where there is no official transcript I can point back to. They don't listen to any of my warnings about over-concluding from my results. As to the former, well I was told recently after doing a sales analysis that ""no one gives a fuck"" about my methodology or results. Drop it from the write up. They just want broad conclusions and actions. 

In my mind, my job is to tell them what I found and let them draw their own conclusions. I get that data science and stats aren't their job, but at the same job, sales isn't mine, so why am I making conclusions for sales people about what they should do?

How do you detect when a data scientist is chasing a wild goose? And how do you prevent them from consuming company resouces unnecessarily?,"Some teams in my organization have empowered data scientists to explore and develop AI/ML use cases, which is a positive initiative, in the sense that data scientistsare now encouraged to engage more with cross functional data. However, we have noticed that this freedom has led to an experimentation spree, resulting in unnecessary expenses and resource allocation. The new data scientists, who joined our org after getting impacted by FAANG layoffs, are insisting on expensive software and cloud technologies that are straining our annual budget. 

This has caused some concern among the more experienced cross-functional data science teams, including mine, who believe that the leadership's generosity towards the new data scientists is misplaced. They strongly opine, although not openly, that the leadership should not be enamored by flashy yet generic AI-ML slide decks and ""data sciency"" quotes being thrown at them by these new age data scientists.  They feel that these inexperienced data scientists are pursuing impractical ideas that do not contribute to the business effectively. 

Additionally, the new data scientists seem uninterested to take-up any other analytical or engineering work apart from coding in  their Jupyter NBs. While it is important for data scientists to experiment, there needs to be a balance and clarity on when to focus and when to halt. Due to lack of data literacy among the leadership, we feel that there is a lack guidelines to prevent inexperienced data scientists from pursuing use cases that do not provide value to the business.

Has anyone ever been in similar situations? Any suggestions on how we can prevent these?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/18y9xbd/how_do_you_detect_when_a_data_scientist_is/
"Hiring managers, is it obvious?","When you interview a candidate, is it blatantly obvious that the interviewee is desperate to get out of their bad job and into your company?

Top 5 things you dislike about your team / role / organization,"Figured we can rant a bit. 

For whatever reason, my team has recently hired a few unqualified MBAs to do management work in the data science space and honestly I think it was the biggest fuck up they've ever made. 

So here are the top 5 things I dislike:
1. Condescending micromanagers. It's not enough that you have daily standup, they want to bug you after lunch and before the day is over to get a ""status report"". Like bro fuck off this is data science not supply chain management. 
2. Too many middle managers (Incompetence meets big egos and we have a middle manager)
3. Daily standups. Most data science peojects are better suited for twice weekly check-ins with ad-hoc meetings between ICs as needed. 
4. General imbalance of management to individual contributors. Every project I've been on is like 8 business people and 2 data scientists and it's completely unnecessary. The data scientists do all of the work while the business people circle jerk strategy that doesn't make sense at all in the context of the data and we litterally have to show them why their idea doesn't make sense on every project multipled times, we're basically training them all over time and it's really unnecessary. 
5. I spend way too much time in meetings to be an IC data scientist. I spend 20 to 25 hours a week in meetings on average and I have to actively participate in all of them.... I could accomplish so much more if I had less BS meetings but that would also require having less BS middle managers, etc.

Transition to Software Engineer,"Hi all, I have been doing data analyst/ tid bit of data science work for 3 years. My company is asking me if I’m interested in transitioning to software engineer. I’m in contracting so the work I would be doing wouldn’t be cutting edge but it would challenge me since I don’t have much experience with traditional software. Pretty much all of my experience comes from data related work so mostly Python, and R. Is this a realistic possibility? I think I would enjoy it but I’m nervous I’m overestimating my skills? If my final goal is data science/ai expert in some way, is this a good detour to take to get there? This is also coming on the heels of receiving a slightly higher offer for basically the same boring work I have been doing for the last little bit. So I basically have to decide to go forward with this transition, or take the other offer doing probably slightly more interesting work than I’m currently doing. I’m at a true crossroads and would appreciate some various perspectives. What are your thoughts?

Helping people get a job in sports analytics!,"Hi everyone.

I'm trying to gather and increase the amount of tips and material related to get a job in sports analytics.

I started creating some articles about it. Some will be tips and experiences, others cool and useful material, curated content etc. It was already hard to get good information about this niche, now with more garbage content on the internet it's harder. I'm trying to put together a source of truth that can be trusted.

This is [the first post.](https://www.sportsjobs.online/blog-post/1how%2520to%2520start%2520your%2520sports%2520analytics%2520career%253f/r/recdeWmEztJQB7TfN)

How many companies actually have a clear plan for their data?,"I have been working as a ""data scientist"" in supply chain for a little over a year at a fortune 500 company. I am the only person with a data related title on my team. There is one small team of people with ""data scientist"" titles in the whole org but they are in a separate silo from me. 

Generally I am tossed tasks that don't make a whole lot of sense: for example comparing forecast accuracy for the exact same models between a no-code out of the box forecaster like SAP IBP with Python models that a contractor they hired built. Other times I will get requests so vague like ""build us a chatbot"". I have always hounded them with questions and shared my opinions on these asks, but basically get told to shut up and go away each time.  

Now they have cut what I can only assume is a few million dollar check with a large consulting company to build out a demand and inventory forecasting model. The thing is, they just launched an out-of-the-box SAP solution less than 2 years ago which does exactly that: inventory and demand forecasting. I can't imagine that project was less than a few million as well. 

In all of this, no one can ever really articulate to me why we are doing this or what specifically they are trying to improve. It seems like they don't even realize the consultants will likely build a very similar model to SAP. 

Are most companies like this? Only some? It has been very stressful for me, as 4 people have also been let go from my team within the year I've worked here. It seems like they have no vision or clue what they are doing.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/179945p/how_many_companies_actually_have_a_clear_plan_for/
Hiring managers: is there a reason for an IC-level Data Analyst/Scientist to speak to every level of leadership?,"I’ve been interviewing for DS and DA roles, none of whom are paying crazy $150K salaries, and I talk to at LEAST 6 people throughout the whole interview process, not including any take-homes or other assessments.

I get talking with the Hiring Manager and teammates, but what gets me is speaking to anyone 1-2 levels higher than the HM.

I ask because as lengthy as the interview process is, it only takes one person to say “no.” And quite frankly, the higher the position, the higher the ego, and it shows in the interviews. I had a VP of Marketing continuously interrupt me, and I’ve had one CMO who simply did not prepare. 

I’d get positive feedback from the Hiring Managers and peers, but then I speak to VP/C-levels and get completely thrown off, and end up not getting the job despite glowing reviews.

I get a lengthy interview process for a DS position if it’s high-paying, high-visibility, but for a DA or IC-level DS?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/14wzrt7/hiring_managers_is_there_a_reason_for_an_iclevel/
"I read posts that make my data analytics company seem a generation or two behind the cutting edge, no ML, etc. But we lead our industry. How's this happen/change?","So my company dominates its industry. Our business data analytics products are viewed as state-of-the-art by any Fortune 500 company in our industry. We're delivering services in a consultant model.

But we're not doing half of the things I read about on here. Don't get me wrong, we're not prosaic, just a couple of generations behind. We have data science teams and all the necessary infrastructure and personnel investments.

I think some of it is the average client user or stakeholder is not terribly data savvy. So maybe our leadership is positioning us to stay with the market, not get ahead of it.

But it seems like the business value would speak for itself if we were closer to the cutting edge.

Edit: These are great perspectives. It's a good reality check too that in most cases, organizations are just muddling through like everyone else.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/147y60x/i_read_posts_that_make_my_data_analytics_company/
"I did an informational interview for an aspiring DS who messaged me on LinkedIn, and now their follow-up asks are getting increasingly time-consuming. How can I gently set a boundary?","**tl;dr: I had a rather odd informational interview with someone almost 3 years ago, and now they’re asking me for resume and cover letter advice out of the blue. We do have colleagues in common — how can I gently/professionally set boundaries?**

I am a (somewhat newly minted) DS at a big tech company. I relied a lot on networking to get to this point, including cold messaging people on LinkedIn, so I’m sympathetic to aspiring folks who ask for career advice. I get occasional requests for this and I’m usually happy to talk with someone for 15-20 minutes or so.

Back in *2020* I accepted a request for an informational interview from an aspiring data analyst — we had a few connections in common. I honestly had forgotten about it until he messaged me yesterday, saying that he wants to apply to a job at my company — and would I review his resume and cover letter for him?

This struck me as odd because:

1) I haven’t heard from him in a long time. He didn’t keep in touch or anything, I literally talked with him for 15 minutes three years ago.

2) It’s a big ask - to review a job description, resume, cover letter and offer good editing advice. 

3) I have the feeling he’s fishing for a referral, which I’m not comfortable giving on account of not knowing him well.

All that said, I know that I’m at my limit of how much I’m willing to accommodate him, and I want to tread carefully because we do have some colleagues in common.Could anyone suggest a nice professional way to communicate this?

Any advice appreciated!

Edit: Thanks for the advice, everyone. I think my initial poor reaction was due to the style of his approach more than anything. Feeling a little sheepish, I’m going to do my best with his resume and see if I can help him on his way.

For the record, the referral system at my company starts with an attestation of how well you know the person - my understanding is that the minimum they request for is “former colleague” (e.g. “I’ve worked with this person in a professional capacity.”) for referrals.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/13g0cug/i_did_an_informational_interview_for_an_aspiring/

I hate my job despite the title and prestige," my manager quit but did a very bad job with documentation and lots of errors. I inherited the work and i had the expectation of delivering. My stakeholder is very demanding and made me old managers life hell. The data source/tool that collects the data is horribly designed and we need to take into account the million ways people will use it. I communicated that i need a data engineer/ someone to help and nobody did anything about it despite saying if need help i can communicate it. I communicated that technical debt needs to be addressed but customer demands results in august. I did everything to best of my ability and my customers subordinates were happy but the actual manager/big customer was not happy. 

Same day i present my work,i get adhoc with delievery next day in data that isnt loaded/fixed and i need to clean it and present it in a matter of hours. I end up fucking it up because the deadline was few hours + more asks from customer last min.  I communicated that this is out of scope and I need more time and everybody just shoved work on my lap that i said i cant do it on such short notice. 

Customer being escalation happy escalated and now I am in trouble.

I got handed shit work, no documentation, and barely any support and after being overworked i still got a big complaint on me. I work weekends and weekdays. Weekdays going up to 8 am to 1 am the next day.

People keep quitting and i honestly see why. Is data science that bad? This was my first job in the field and I genuinely regret taking this role, I saw the red flags and took this over the other role. 

Fyi: everyone who ever worked on this quit. Its a cursed project. Both coworkers + customer’s subordinates. This shit makes me lose sleep.literally people will take less pay and worse title if it means they dont deal with this.


Honestly, some jobs are not worth it. Like its actually just not worth the money or title. I would take any junior title with low pay over this shit. Neither seniors nor middle level people would take this crap. none of my coworkers would touch this work with a 10 foot pole yet it keeps blowing up in my face.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/1653342/i_hate_my_job_despite_the_title_and_prestige/

"Self-taught coder in first role. Want to job hop, but paralyzed by fear of the unknown. Dose of realism needed. Please help.","Apologies in advance for the ramble. I’m just really in need of some objective advice right now.

So far I consider myself a moderate success story: With zero relevant education or experience, in my 30s I taught myself math, stats, and coding, then scored a job as a junior machine learning research engineer. In this job I analyze large data sets, run deep learning experiments in the cloud using large pre-trained models, and write back end code to serve these models for inference in operational products. My work is a mixture of ML research and MLOps. I’ve trained thousands of models, written tens (maybe low hundreds?) of thousands of lines of code, and even been listed on a couple papers and one patent. As a junior engineer I’m mostly told what to do, but I have significant freedom to decide how best to do it. This was exactly my goal when I first embarked on my improbable journey.

I’ve been in this role for 2.5 years now. I’ve learned so much and really loved it. But lately the sheen has worn off, and dissatisfaction has started to creep in. Basically I just need more money to support my family, and this job isn’t going to deliver it fast enough.

So now I feel significant pressure to find my second MLE job, but everything about that prospect terrifies me. My current job is all I’ve ever known in tech, and I’m just not experienced enough to get a feel for how competitive I’ll be in the market. I still feel weak compared to many colleagues, but maybe it’s just imposter syndrome. Also, my ML subfield (NLP) is moving so fast these days that the moment you learn something new it’s already out of date, making it impossible to ascertain how comprehensive or current my skill set actually is. So I just really don’t know.

Anyway, here is a grab bag of my skills and credentials, I guess:

- Education

    - Two MA degrees, one marginally relevant to NLP but not STEM/computational at all, so probably won’t wow any engineering managers

- Python

    - Very proficient

    - Have written tons of it, including packages, but almost all is internal/proprietary

    - Familiar with most of the basic ML/data analysis libraries, and some familiarity with deep learning libraries like PyTorch and transformers (never used TensorFlow)

- Linux

    - Fairly proficient

    - I use Bash and zsh everyday, both locally and on remote servers over ssh, writing and reading shell scripts with low-to-moderate complexity 
- SQL

    - Basic proficiency

    - I can compose simple SQL queries, and some moderately complex ones with Google’s help, but that’s about it. Not doing much with DBs these days.

- Software development

    - Fair amount of experience for 2.5 years, I think

    - I’ve worked with teams of other engineers and PhDs to to write the back ends of our ML-driven engines and software packages

    - I work every day with Git, CI/CD, testing, conda, and OOP, basically all in Python

    - We use the Agile framework. I fucking hate it, but anyway, I know the concepts and lingo

- AWS

    - Not certified, but familiar with the basic concepts and services. Never used any other cloud provider

    - We do most of our experimentation on S3-backed EC2, but are starting to use the SageMaker ecosystem now

- Math/stats

    - Strong enough algebra, calculus, linear algebra, and statistics to understand deep learning techniques and read the occasional research paper

    - No classes or grades or anything to prove this though. I just used Khan Academy for everything, so there’s no real paper trail

Beyond the above, I have started (though not finished) a handful of pet projects on GitHub and completed an absolute assload of MOOCs (I think I have like 26 Coursera certificates).

Things I’m still weak on include:

- Networking

    - As someone with a non-CS, non-STEM background, I have very few connections in the tech industry. Basically my network consists of my current coworkers and a few ex-coworkers who recently left

- Front end

    - Never built a website, dashboard, or GUI of any kind. If someone asked me to surface the outputs of a model to users, I’d have almost no idea where to begin. I could probably figure it out, but it’s not something I can currently

    - For this reason I feel as far from full-stack as one can be

- Data structures and algorithms

    - This is something I never directly studied, but rather have just picked up the very basics as needed on the job. As such my knowledge is superficial, patchy, and incomplete at best

    - I basically understand Big-O and the basic data structures. It’s been sufficient for my current job, but that’s it

    - Have never done any LeetCode or similar

Essentially my credentials boil down to “Someone else hired me as an MLE 2.5 years ago and hasn't fired me, so I can’t be *completely* incompetent, right…?” Lol. That just doesn’t seem very strong. If we used GitHub at work, such that hiring managers etc. could at least peruse what I’ve done, that would be great, but we don’t, so they can’t. Meanwhile, many would-be applicants will surely have degrees, publicly accessible school projects, and GPAs to point to, or else have at least as much work experience as me if not more.

So ... am I ready to jump? How can I assess whether I’m prepared, whether I’ll be competitive at all, and in which areas I absolutely must improve? I guess I just need more confidence and assurance in order to take the next step.

Is my internship worthless?,"I accepted an internship about 2 months ago at a very large tech company. The internship has nothing to do with my major (which is data science), and even in the interview process my boss effectively said “this isn’t a real job, but it’s a stepping stone”.

I was very excited for the opportunity to work for this company because I knew it would look great on a resume. But, I’m 32 years old (started college later than most) and the pay is fucking abysmal. On top of poor pay, it’s a commuter job and I have to drive minimum 1 hr every shift to work. Coming from working as a catering chef, this has been miserable. The pay is worse, the job is boring, there’s zero benefits, and because of Covid the networking connections while at work are effectively non existent (which was a selling point).

So my question is, is this even really worth it? After experiencing the work culture and what this company is like, I absolutely cannot see myself working for them post graduation, nor do they have much of a need in data science. Is it worth roughing out the internship to just simply put it on my resume?

"Everyone always talks about LLMs/ML in data science but no one ever talks about experimentation, ML's older sexier sister.","As a data scientist primarily focused in causal inference and experiment design, I find that most conversation and questions from people trying to transition into DS always want to go into ML, but causal inference and experimentation is another very fun sub-field within DS. I'm biased since I'm in this sub-field but having done some ML stuff on the side, I much more enjoy the causal inference side of things.

Note that this post is primarily geared toward people with some experience. It's hard to break into experimentation with no background. Fresh PhDs though, particularly in social or physical sciences do well.

What's fun about about experimentation and causal inference:

1. Knowing why something caused something else is always valuable
2. Well designed experiments can be hard to design and execute, which is part of the challenge. A good experiment correctly captures the objectives of the product manager/business partner and answers a question that can be immediately acted upon once results are available.
3. Requires a combination of business thinking, strategy, and strong statistical foundations
4. Often is highly collaborative and builds your soft skills. I work with people in marketing, risk, finance, modeling, dashboarding teams to make sure things work well
5. Causal inference is not just A/B testing. There are plenty of situations where we need to get a causal understanding but an experiment is just not feasible. Tons of fun techniques here like instrumental variables, propensity score matching, causal forests, double ML etc. which have their own strengths and weaknesses
6. Experimentation is not just A/B testing. We have multi-arm bandits, factorial and fractional factorial experiment designs etc.
7. Usually don't have to worry about productionizing etc. ML is often 5 lines of code once you've massaged the data just right
8. It's a growing field. I see lots of job openings in experimentation and the skillset is hard to come by. It's not easy to do causal inference (both the experimental and non-experimental kind) and all the challenges of launching a business experiment require on the job training to be successful at.

If you're in the market for a new role, don't overlook experimentation (or think of it as less fun) :).

I have a ton of free compute... why won't anybody use it?,"I'm working on a dev tool that automatically scales python code horizontally to thousands of CPUs and GPUs. I have been working on this for the last two months and have a few consistent users.

I recently scraped emails from some of the largest python repos on github. Most of them are repos specifically for Bioinformaticians, Data Scientists, NLP Engineers, and people in the AI/ML space. Since I compiled this list of 50k emails and sent them out I'm getting a 5% response rate which isn't bad at all. About 50% of the responses are positive and a majority of them are people saying they think the idea is cool and they want to try it. I excepted more of them to covert to user... at a bare minimum a one time user. Realistically it has probably drove 30 people to give the tool a go.

What I'm asking this community is A) what are some ideas to generate product traction? B) If you had $100k worth of free GPU hours how would you get people to use them for you?

What does learning look like as senior?,"There was a “how much ML do you use in your daily workflow” post recently. Most answers were “little to none” since most businesses don’t have need for a bunch of ML. That doesn’t mean a seasoned and tenured DS shouldn’t be senior at that company. So if you’re senior and still learning, and things like LLM’s or deep learning aren’t applicable, what do you spend your time learning to take yourself to the next level?

Context - I’m a sr. DS at a company that doesn’t need ML, but I feel pressured to learn more advanced ML techniques to move up or be considered a “real Sr. DS”.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/14em1me/what_does_learning_look_like_as_senior/
What is the most versatile regression method?,"TLDR: I worked as a data scientist a couple of years back, for most things throwing XGBoost at it was a simple and good enough solution. Is that still the case, or have there emerged new methods that are similarly ""universal"" (with a massive asterisk)?

To give background to the question, let's start with me. I am a software/ML engineer in Python, R, and Rust and have some data science experience from a couple of years back. Furthermore, I did my undergrad in Econometrics and a graduate degree in Statistics, so I am very familiar with most concepts. I am currently interviewing to switch jobs and the math round and coding round went really well, now I am invited over for a final ""data challenge"" in which I will have roughly 1h and a synthetic dataset with the goal of achieving some sort of prediction.

&#x200B;

My problem is: I am not fluent in data analysis anymore and have not really kept up with recent advancements. Back when was doing DS work, for most use cases using XGBoost was totally fine and received good enough results. This would have definitely been my go-to choice in 2019 to solve the challenge at hand. My question is: In general, is this still a good strategy, or should I have another go-to model?  


Disclaimer: Yes, I am absolutely, 100% aware that different models and machine learning techniques serve different use cases. I have experience as an MLE, but I am not going to build a custom Net for this task given the small scope. I am just looking for something that should handle most reasonable use cases well enough.

&#x200B;

I appreciate any and all insights as well as general tips. The reason why I believe this question is appropriate, is because I want to start a general discussion about which basic model is best for rather standard predictive tasks (regression and classification).",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/19abxl3/what_is_the_most_versatile_regression_method/
Word of advice on taking on a Data Science masters (from someone who just completed one),"I just graduated with a masters in data science from a uk university. To say it was difficult would be an understatement, and it’s not just the program itself that made it so, but two external factors which (I’ll list below) made studying a challenge. 



1. WORK: If you have a hard job already, DON’T combine it with a data science masters. You could literally breakdown completely due to stress. My school recommend working only 10 hours per week and I ignored the advice because I needed the money. I worked 20 hours per week doing menial jobs. At some point I thought I would actually drop dead due to stress. Keep in mind that 20 hours is still part time work. I strongly recommend working a maximum  10 hours per week or not working at all if you’re prone to stress.   My classmates who worked full time during their masters had very poor grades (some even dropped out). 



2. Family and peer support:  I always thought of myself as a lone journeyman who took on the world without needing to speak to anyone. Uhh…. Yeah that went out the window completely when things got heated during the program. Not seeing family in the flesh  affected my mental health. I noticed that people who took the program with their families  were a lot happier than those of us who didn’t have any family around. Speaking to family, friends and classmates going through the same program really helped A LOT though. You really can’t go through this program as a loner. Life would hit you on the face like a brick for every single day of your existence if you attempt to do so. 

That’s my 2 cents. AA

EDIT: 
Course Selection: Just remembered this but uhh course selection is REALLY IMPORTANT. I had done enough online courses on data science before my masters, to know that neural networks and deep learning is something you study ON YOUR OWN, and  NOT as part of an official course. If you’re new to data science, pick the easiest courses for your masters. I saw enough people completely fail their courses (and subsequently the entire masters) because they wanted courses that sound trendy. Seriously that’s the only reason they chose them. Please research “Natural Language Engineering” and “Combinatorial Optimisation” before choosing it as a course alright. 😂😂",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/180kgb9/word_of_advice_on_taking_on_a_data_science/

"Explaining how generative AI works in code, from scratch, without excessive math","This community has been tremendously helpful for me when I was first breaking into data science and MLE, and I'm looking to give back through free online education.

Unfortunately, a lot of AI/ML resources online, especially those for generative AI, are way too math heavy and focus more on tedious proofs rather than what you actually need to know for side projects or to work as an MLE.

Data science manager conundrum,"Hello everyone. As a data science manager, managing a team in a rather complex organizational structure, I find myself in a bit of fix. While I enjoy people management and helping solve non technical problems and suggesting methods in technical aspects for the team to solve, it also leaves me with little to no time to do any data science stuff as most of my days are filled in meetings, responding to emails, team strategy, finances etc. I am worried about my tag as a data scientist as I continue to be involved in the managerial path, forget anything leetcode level. I would massively fail there at this stage of my career. Most companies that are hiring seem to want people who excel at technical stuff while managing teams. While personally this seems impractical when implementing, I would still need to crack interviews that might be heavy on data science stack. 

So the question is, how do I manage to keep my self updated on technical stuff when I barely have the time in my role? I could keep brushing some of my core data stuff in the time outside my work hours but learning continuously on the side is going to eat away into any of my personal time as well. Advice?

I don't even think he reads beyond the headlines. He makes crazy statements like, ""Save me $250 million dollars by using machine learning for problem X."" He and his narcissistic enabler coworker, who may be slightly more competent than the manager, don't want to hear about ML feasibility studies, working with stakeholders to refine requirements, and establishing whether ML is the right solution, data quality checks... They just want to plow through code because ""we are agile."" You can't have detailed technical discussions because they don't know enough about data science.

I’m really getting frustrated with my career trajectory.,"I’m hoping to get some career advice. I was a special operator in the military on active duty, the kind you go through selection for, and did intelligence work when I was much younger.  I then transitioned to officer where I was managing a couple of large intelligence cells at up to division level. When I got out and was pursuing a masters I managed two very large restaurants as a general manager. After graduating I became a data scientist where I applied my work toward national security problems as a contractor. As an individual contributor I often worked with some high level military leaders. 

I left to go work at a tech company as an individual contributor because i wanted the credentials of having worked in tech and the money was good. I expected to rapidly grow here into leadership but I feel my role is stagnant and I’m not growing as a leader nor do I feel the opportunities are going to present themselves. I want to be in a role where I can help by making leadership decisions for an organization and managing teams but I feel stuck. I fully expected data science to help me in my leadership ambitions because you understand the technical aspects far better but it hasn’t been in the cards. The money here is good but I don’t enjoy not being a decision maker. 

Not that I don’t think PMs are valuable but it frustrates me when I end up with someone with very little practical experience sitting over me as a PM. 

I dunno maybe I’m just being jealous because I took this path over a PM path.

Why Gradient Boosted Decision Trees are so underappreciated in the industry?,"GBDT allow you to iterate very fast, they require no data preprocessing, enable you to incorporate business heuristics directly as features, and immediately show if there is explanatory power in features in relation to the target.

On tabular data problems, they outperform Neural Networks, and many use cases in the industry have tabular datasets.

Because of those characteristics, [they are winning solutions to all tabular competitions on Kaggle](https://jobs-in-data.com/blog/data-science-skills#sota-ml-models).

And yet, somehow they are not very popular.

On the chart below, I summarized learnings from 9,261 job descriptions crawled from 1605 companies in Jun-Sep 2023 (source: [https://jobs-in-data.com/blog/machine-learning-vs-data-scientist](https://jobs-in-data.com/blog/machine-learning-vs-data-scientist))

LGBM, XGboost, Catboost (combined together) are the 19th mentioned skill, e.g. with Tensorflow being x10 more popular.

It seems to me Neural Networks caught the attention of everyone, because of the deep-learning hype, which is justified for image, text, or speech data, but not justified for tabular data, which still represents many use - cases.

EDIT \[Answering the main lines of critique\]:

1/ ""Job posting descriptions are written by random people and hence meaningless"":

Granted, there is for sure some noise in the data generation process of writing job descriptions.

But why do those random people know so much more about deep learning, keras, tensorflow, pytorch than GBDT? In other words, why is there a systematic trend in the noise? When the noise has a trend, it ceases to be noise.

Very few people actually did try to answer this, and I am grateful to them, but none of the explanations seem to be more credible than the statement that GBDTs are indeed underappreciated in the industry.

2/ ""I myself use GBDT all the time so the headline is wrong""This is availability bias. The single person's opinion (or 20 people opinion) vs 10.000 data points.

3/ ""This is more the bias of the Academia""

The job postings are scraped from the industry.

However, I personally think this is the root cause of the phenomenon. Academia shapes the minds of industry practitioners. GBDTs are not interesting enough for Academia because they do not lead to AGI.

This is what companies look for when hiring data analysts,"For anyone interested, here are some of the trends that we have observed in the world of data when it comes to career as a data analyst/data scientist. (We are a German based data & software recruitment agency).

The role of a data analyst was in some ways more well defined previously. Where there are fewer possibilities, there are fewer expectations. Now, by the proliferation of tools and expansion of expectation, it blends increasingly with that of a data scientist. 

It’s now essential to have expertise in one or more programming languages, as well as database querying methodologies, both of which we’ll explore in more detail. 

Proficiency in R and Python, as well as knowing how to utilise DBT (data building tool). More on this [here](https://www.pl-talents.com/expertise-to-look-out-for-when-hiring-a-data-analyst/). 

Data analysts work with databases, so they absolutely need familiarity with writing SQL queries. PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.

Additionally, data analysts can benefit from expertise with SQL-related technologies and frameworks:  SQLAlchemy,  Apache Spark SQL, HiveQL.

Data Visualisation and Storytelling tools. 

Working with databases is one thing, but data analysts need more than SQL. Data analysts now handle more complex and diverse datasets, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. 

\+  Proficiency in statistical analysis is crucial for data analysts.

How to correctly use sklearn Transformers in a Pipeline,"  This article will explain how to use [Pipeline](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com) and [Transformers](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/data_transforms.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com) correctly in Scikit-Learn (sklearn) projects to speed up and reuse our model training process.

This piece complements and clarifies the official documentation on Pipeline examples and some common misunderstandings.

I hope that after reading this, you'll be able to use the Pipeline, an excellent design, to better complete your machine learning tasks.

 This article was originally published on my personal blog [Data Leads Future.](https://www.dataleadsfuture.com/ensuring-correct-use-of-transformers-in-scikit-learn-pipeline/) 

### Why use a Pipeline

As mentioned earlier, in a machine learning task, we often need to use various Transformers for data scaling and feature dimensionality reduction before training a model.

This presents several challenges:

* **Code complexity**: For each use of a Transformer, we have to go through initialization, `fit_transform`, and `transform` steps. Missing one step during a transformation could derail the entire training process.
* **Data leakage**: As we discussed, for each Transformer, we fit with train data and then transform both train and test data. We must avoid letting the distribution of the test data leak into the train data.
* **Code reusability**: A machine learning model includes not only the trained Estimator for prediction but also the data preprocessing steps. Therefore, a machine learning task comprising Transformers and an Estimator should be atomic and indivisible.
* **Hyperparameter tuning**: After setting up the steps of machine learning, we need to adjust hyperparameters to find the best combination of Transformer parameter values.

Scikit-Learn introduced the `Pipeline` module to solve these issues.

### What is a Pipeline

A `Pipeline` is a module in Scikit-Learn that implements the chain of responsibility design pattern.

When creating a Pipeline, we use the `steps` parameter to chain together multiple Transformers for initialization:

    from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
    from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    
    pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[('scaler', StandardScaler()),
                               ('pca', PCA(n_components=2, random_state=42)),
                               ('estimator', RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=3, max_depth=5))])

The [official documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#pipeline) points out that the last Transformer must be an Estimator.

If you don't need to specify each Transformer's name, you can simplify the creation of a Pipeline with `make_pipeline`:

    from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
    
    pipeline_2 = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(),
                               PCA(n_components=2, random_state=42),
                               RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=3, max_depth=5))

 Understanding the Pipeline's mechanism from the source code

We've mentioned the importance of not letting test data variables leak into training data when using each Transformer.

This principle is relatively easy to ensure when each data preprocessing step is independent.

But what if we integrate these steps using a Pipeline?

If we look at the [official documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#pipeline), we find it simply uses the fit  
 method on the entire dataset without explaining how to handle train and test data separately.

With this question in mind, I dived into the Pipeline's source code to find the answer.

Reading the source code revealed that although Pipeline implements `fit`, `fit_transform`, and `predict` methods, they work differently from regular Transformers.

Take the following Pipeline creation process as an example:

    from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
    from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    
    pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[('scaler', StandardScaler()),
                               ('pca', PCA(n_components=2, random_state=42)),
                               ('estimator', RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=3, max_depth=5))])

 The internal implementation can be represented by the following diagram: 

[ Internal implementation of the fit and predict methods when called. Image by Author ](https://preview.redd.it/okhwyg75gl7c1.png?width=684&format=png&auto=webp&s=8106360fcaeb17deea2adf04fc34228dd31a9fd7)

As you can see, when we call the `fit` method, Pipeline first separates Transformers from the Estimator.

For each Transformer, Pipeline checks if there's a `fit_transform` method; if so, it calls it; otherwise, it calls `fit`.

For the Estimator, it calls `fit` directly.

For the `predict` method, Pipeline separates Transformers from the Estimator.

Pipeline calls each Transformer's `transform` method in sequence, followed by the Estimator's `predict`  
 method.

Therefore, when using a Pipeline, we still need to split train and test data. Then we simply call `fit` on the train data and `predict` on the test data.

There's a special case when combining Pipeline with `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning: you don't need to manually split train and test data. I'll explain this in more detail in the best practices section.

## Best Practices for Using Transformers and Pipeline in Actual Applications

Now that we've discussed the working principles of Transformers and Pipeline, it's time to fulfill the promise made in the title and talk about the best practices when combining Transformers with Pipeline in real projects.

### Combining Pipeline with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

In a machine learning project, selecting the right dataset processing and algorithm is one aspect. After debugging the initial steps, it's time for parameter optimization.

Using `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV`, you can try different parameters for the Estimator to find the best fit:

    import time
    
    from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
    
    pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[('scaler', StandardScaler()),
                               ('pca', PCA()),
                               ('estimator', RandomForestClassifier())])
    param_grid = {'pca__n_components': [2, 'mle'],
                  'estimator__n_estimators': [3, 5, 7],
                  'estimator__max_depth': [3, 5]}
    
    start = time.perf_counter()
    clf = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid=param_grid, cv=5, n_jobs=4)
    clf.fit(X, y)
    
    # It takes 2.39 seconds to finish the search on my laptop.
    print(f""It takes {time.perf_counter() - start} seconds to finish the search."")

 But in machine learning, hyperparameter tuning is not limited to Estimator parameters; it also involves combinations of Transformer parameters.

Integrating all steps with Pipeline allows for hyperparameter tuning of every element with different parameter combinations.

Note that during hyperparameter tuning, we no longer need to manually split train and test data. `GridSearchCV` will split the data into training and validation sets using [StratifiedKFold](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#stratified-k-fold), which implemented a k-fold cross validation mechanism.

[ StratifiedKFold iterative process of splitting train data and test data. Image by Author ](https://preview.redd.it/uqnuo8fpgl7c1.png?width=681&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd6b5f7edb2d4f5e71786fd6c0f45745ea2095d9)

 We can also set the number of folds for cross-validation and choose how many workers to use. The tuning process is illustrated in the following diagram: 

[ Internal implementation of GridSearchCV hyperparameter tuning. Image by Author ](https://preview.redd.it/piqqv9nrgl7c1.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bb2a2d4739e8100e71559fb9f9e0cfaa4846803)

 Due to space constraints, I won't go into detail about `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV` here. If you're interested, I can write another article explaining them next time. 

### Using the memory parameter to cache Transformer outputs

Of course, hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV` can be slow, but that's no worry, Pipeline provides a caching mechanism to speed up the tuning efficiency by caching the results of intermediate steps.

When initializing a Pipeline, you can pass in a memory parameter, which will cache the results after the first call to `fit` and `transform` for each transformer.

If subsequent calls to fit and `transform` use the same parameters, which is very likely during hyperparameter tuning, these steps will directly read the results from the cache instead of recalculating, significantly speeding up the efficiency when running the same Transformer repeatedly.

The `memory` parameter can accept the following values:

* The default is None: caching is not used.
* A string: providing a path to store the cached results.
* A `joblib.Memory` object: allows for finer-grained control, such as configuring the storage backend for the cache.

Next, let's use the previous `GridSearchCV` example, this time adding `memory` to the Pipeline to see how much speed can be improved:

    pipeline_m = Pipeline(steps=[('scaler', StandardScaler()),
                               ('pca', PCA()),
                               ('estimator', RandomForestClassifier())],
                          memory='./cache')
    start = time.perf_counter()
    clf_m = GridSearchCV(pipeline_m, param_grid=param_grid, cv=5, n_jobs=4)
    clf_m.fit(X, y)
    
    # It takes 0.22 seconds to finish the search with memory parameter.
    print(f""It takes {time.perf_counter() - start} seconds to finish the search with memory."")

As shown, with caching, the tuning process only takes 0.2 seconds, a significant speed increase from the previous 2.4 seconds.

### How to debug Scikit-Learn Pipeline

After integrating Transformers into a Pipeline, the entire preprocessing and transformation process becomes a black box. It can be difficult to understand which step the process is currently on.

Fortunately, we can solve this problem by adding logging to the Pipeline.  
We need to create custom transformers to add logging at each step of data transformation.

Here's an example of adding logging with Python's standard logging library:

First, you need to configure a logger:

    import logging
    
    from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin
    
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
    logger = logging.getLogger()

 Next, you can create a custom Transformer and add logging within its methods: 

    class LoggingTransformer(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
        def __init__(self, transformer):
            self.transformer = transformer
            self.real_name = self.transformer.__class__.__name__
    
        def fit(self, X, y=None):
            logging.info(f""Begin fit: {self.real_name}"")
            self.transformer.fit(X, y)
            logging.info(f""End fit: {self.real_name}"")
            return self
    
        def fit_transform(self, X, y=None):
            logging.info(f""Begin fit_transform: {self.real_name}"")
            X_fit_transformed = self.transformer.fit_transform(X, y)
            logging.info(f""End fit_transform: {self.real_name}"")
            return X_fit_transformed
    
        def transform(self, X):
            logging.info(f""Begin transform: {self.real_name}"")
            X_transformed = self.transformer.transform(X)
            logging.info(f""End transform: {self.real_name}"")
            return X_transformed

 Then you can use this `LoggingTransformer` when creating your Pipeline: 

    pipeline_logging = Pipeline(steps=[('scaler', LoggingTransformer(StandardScaler())),
                                 ('pca', LoggingTransformer(PCA(n_components=2))),
                                 ('estimator', RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=5, max_depth=3))])
    pipeline_logging.fit(X_train, y_train)

[ The effect after adding the LoggingTransformer. Image by Author ](https://preview.redd.it/53kl3padhl7c1.png?width=664&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3e3d9dcf25f0ee8dc7234e1db9280ce1cd15b0d)

When you use `pipeline.fit`, it will call the `fit` and `transform` methods for each step in turn and log the appropriate messages.

### Use passthrough in Scikit-Learn Pipeline

In a Pipeline, a step can be set to `'passthrough`', which means that for this specific step, the input data will pass through unchanged to the next step.

This is useful when you want to selectively enable/disable certain steps in a complex pipeline.

Taking the code example above, we know that when using `DecisionTree` or `RandomForest`, standardizing the data is unnecessary, so we can use `passthrough` to skip this step.

An example would be as follows:

    param_grid = {'scaler': ['passthrough'],
                  'pca__n_components': [2, 'mle'],
                  'estimator__n_estimators': [3, 5, 7],
                  'estimator__max_depth': [3, 5]}
    clf = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid=param_grid, cv=5, n_jobs=4)
    clf.fit(X, y)

 Reusing the Pipeline

After a journey of trials and tribulations, we finally have a well-performing machine learning model.

Now, you might consider how to reuse this model, share it with colleagues, or deploy it in a production environment.

However, the result of a model's training includes not only the model itself but also the various data processing steps, which all need to be saved.

Using `joblib` and Pipeline, we can save the entire training process for later use. The following code provides a simple example:

    from joblib import dump, load
    
    # save pipeline
    dump(pipeline, 'model_pipeline.joblib')
    
    # load pipeline
    loaded_pipeline = load('model_pipeline.joblib')
    
    # predict with loaded pipeline
    loaded_predictions = loaded_pipeline.predict(X_test)

Would a PhD help?,"I have a MS in Mechanical Engineering and work as a Data Scientist at a big tech company. But my role is hardly Data Science. I mostly just work on trying to use the company’s AI technology for MVPs for clients. I haven’t coded in over a year. The technology isn’t that great and we don’t get many clients. Right now, I’m literally typing out text in text image documents because our AI can’t handle it. Prior to this, I worked at General Motors as a Data Scientist and no one knew what they were doing there either.

I’ve been applying outside and haven’t gotten anything. I’m wondering if a PhD would help me secure a job with real Data Science. I was looking through LinkedIn and I saw a lot of Data Scientists at top companies have Physics PhDs. I’ve always been interested in physics but I thought the PhD wasn’t justifiable. 

Pay wise I’m doing great. Satisfaction wise, not so much.

Let me know if anyone has any advice.

EDIT:
I guess I should clarify. I think I could probably get a ""real DS job"" without a PhD and I don't think it is required. Here are the reasons I would consider a PhD:

1) I have no demonstrable Data Science professional experience in the work experience I have. This makes getting a new Data Science job challenging. With a PhD, I can get some real DS work experience solving complex problems

2) With a PhD, I could specialize in a science I'm interested in and become a scientist exploring that topic with the aide of DS rather than DS working in tech to help companies increase ad revenue. Basically, it feels like being a specialty DS, like a Climate Data Scientist or a Bioinformatics Data Scientist would benefit from a PhD. I could be wrong though.

Been stuck on a problem. Just need to know whether this problem statement is solvable or not.,"I've been stuck on the following problem for weeks now. To be clear I'm not asking the community to provide a full solution. Just a few ideas or at least confirmation on whether this problem statement is solvable with the data available at hand. Thanks.

**Context:** I work for a company that rents out stuff. During user checkout, there's a rule-based risk engine that determines whether to auto-approve user (takes seconds) or send for manual approval (takes days). This engine utilizes only basic features such as credit score, rent items category, cart value etc. Lets say that around 40% of all instances go to manual approval. Actual rejection rate is around 1-2% that means most of the cases sent for manual approval could have just been auto-approved.

**Objective:** Reduce dependency on manual approval as much as possible (to lets say 5%). If this was a binary classification task (manual or not) then we'd say recall is important here. Thus, deprecate legacy system as it is too rudimentary.

Now, boss wants me to achieve this by creating a regression model using customer credit history, and purchase history to predict ***maximum allowed***  ^(†)***active-sourcing-cost per user***. So that if a user tries checking out cart that brings their total active sourcing cost above their max allowed limit, they will be sent for manual approval instead of auto-approve.

>^(†)*active-sourcing-cost is the total purchase cost to company of all items the user currently is renting*

**Data available:** User purchase history, user credit history (experian), product details, NPA data (data of users who failed to return the items they have rented, thus defaulted)

**Issues with proposed solution:**

1. Max allowed sourcing cost per user unavailable as the target variable (No recorded ground truth for any samples)
2. No relevant proxy variables available as ground truth (that I can think of)

Tried explaining that lack of relevant ground truth is an issue. But am being pushed for a solution so have to produce.

**My alternate half-baked solution:**

1. Use legacy system for auto approvals only. This acts as a filter.
2. To the rest of the data that would otherwise be sent for manual verification we add NPA users and tag as a negative class. This would be the training data.
3. Train binary classification model (npa vs. not npa).
4. What the model classifies as NPA would then be sent for manual, rest will be auto approved.

Career Movement After Hitting Manager,"Hi all,

I’m looking for people’s advice on making potentially a downward move in my DS career. Basically, I work for a company with a relatively small DS department in a relatively low-paying business sector. Because I got in on the team early, and I have good people skills, I got promoted to a manager position about a year and a half ago. The company is good to work for, and I don’t mind management work, but the pay gap that comes with the industry has been feeling like more of an opportunity cost the longer I stay there, so I’ve started to look at other positions.

I’m guessing it would be hard to manage a team in another industry without the requisite domain experience, so my question is this: would it be seen as a negative on my resume if I ended up having to take a “lower-level” DS job to get experience in that industry, or is that more common than I think? I’m less concerned about a pay decrease since I’m pretty sure it will be an increase either way, but I’m thinking of how it might look on a resume.

For additional context, I have about 4 years of DS experience, all in my current industry, which I’m keeping a secret in case someone from my employer is on here :)

"Happy Holidays! Here is the complete 100% free, NLP and LLM Outline","Thanks for all of your support in recent days by giving me feedback on my NLP outline. It builds on work that I have done at AT&T and Toyota. It also builds on a lot of work that I have done on my own outside of corporations. 

The outline is solid, and as my way of giving back to the community, I am it giving away for free. That's right, no annoying email sign-up. No gimmicks. No asking you to buy a timeshare in Florida at the end of the  outline. It's just a link to a zip file which contains the outline and sample code. 

Here is how it works. First, you need to know Python. If you don't know that, then look up how to learn Python on Google. Second, this is an outline, you need to look at each part, go through the links, and really digest the material before moving on. Third, every part of the outline is dense; there is no fluff, and you will will probably need to do multiple passes through the outline.

Also, think of this outline as a gift. It is being provided without warranty, or any guarantee of any kind.  

If you like the outline, hit that share button and share this with someone. Maybe it will help them as well.

How to version control Jupyter notebook?,"Many times  write a  long code and a major portion of the code needs to be changed, but I might need the old code for reference.

How to deal with data scientists,"I'm an R&D engineer working for an international company in the chemical/engineering business. I am the only one in my team with some data analytics skills. I typically spend about 20% of my time coding and analysing data for my projects (sometimes I get asked to support other colleagues too). Nothing fancy, some statistical analysis, a lot of data viz and sometimes simple modelling mostly for inferential purposes.
Over the years my company built a relatively large and very centralized data science team, they do the heavy lifting and create production quality code.  
In the early days I enjoyed dealing with them, they were happy that I could read the code and understand the lingo so we could cooperate very smoothly on the same project. Typically we went through their code together on a weekly basis. By the end of the project  I was aware of most of the technical decision made along the way and I could explain it pretty comfortably to the stakeholders. So much so that I started thing about a career switch. Now that team is gone and the newcomers are more senior and operate very differently. They typically provide their report on powerpoint and quite high level too, I had a few instances when I reached out and got dismissed. One particular time after they analysed some data for an RD&E project I asked the code specifying that I was really eager to learn and I got denied. Their justification was that they were afraid their code would be used the wrong way.  
They don't seem to be interested in cooperating the same way, they rather get the data, ask all the questions, and share their final findings. They do not interact much along the way.

This situation has been going on for over a year already, I thought I could find a sweet spot bridging between RD&E and data science, but I'm now having second thoughts and thinking I'm better off in my bubble. I'm very hesitant involving them in any project unless strictly necessary.   
I'm interested to hear some opinion from data scientists as I'm trying to put myself in their shoes. Am I being too intrusive? Have you ever had similar experiences from the opposite side? Also do you have any career advice? Is there any value for someone with a foot in both shoes?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/194prhf/how_to_deal_with_data_scientists/

So what are some good questions to ask your next prospect boss?

As a hiring manager myself, here are some of my favorite questions from my best candidates:

**To learn more about the day-to-day:**

* What's the day-to-day like for you (or for a data scientist on your team)?
* What percentage of your time (a DS on the team) is spent on coding?
* What percentage for other tasks? And what are those tasks?

**To learn more about ownership:**

* How are projects assigned across the team?
* How do team members collaborate?
* How is the scope of a project typically determined? 

**There are more you can ask to learn more about scope of projects and to learn more about room for adaptability:**

The pay is good but the work is mind numbingly slow and I am losing all my motivation to work. I have been put into an intermediary DS pm sort of role and I help guide the development of models.

Most of my work is just documentation and approvals and standards even before we manage to build a prototype we have to go through 100 fucking hoops and clearly redundant processes with glaring repetition of work but no senior management is willing to take a look at streamling that mess. Projects take months often years to complete and it's not like all the models are SOTA

I understand that banking is heavily regulated and I shouldn't expect the amount of independence as one perhaps gets in FAANG but still it feels like 80% of my job is just initiationg approvals and doing documentation.

Should I relocate for first job?,"I was offered an MLE role that pays \~100K + options (pre-IPO) at a mid sized and well funded startup. This is also my first full time offer that I've received (I am a recent new grad). The hitch however - is that they want me to relocate to their office to be on site (not a coast city but think L/MCOL midwest type city).

The request comes at a bit of a surprise because I communicated throughout the process that I would prefer to stay in my home state. Though, I also said I wouldn't mind onboarding on site and flying out when needed either - and in the moment they seemed receptive about this.

Since getting the offer I have been feeling strong reservations about leaving to relocate. In my home state I have both parents (one of which has an ongoing health condition), many of my closest friends, as well as a long term girlfriend of six years.

I am curious to hear what other people who've been in similar circumstances have done. One thought I had was that I could ""suck-it-up"" for a year and just get the experience down - but I am not sure if this is a good mindset to be going into a job with.

# TLDR

**upsetty** is a Python package I built to create UpSet plots and visualize intersecting sets. You can use the project yourself by installing with:

    pip install upsetty 

Project GitHub Page: [https://github.com/eskin22/upsetty](https://github.com/eskin22/upsetty)

Project PyPI Page: [https://pypi.org/project/upsetty/](https://pypi.org/project/upsetty/)

# Background

Recently I received a work assignment where the business partners wanted us to analyze the overlap of users across different platforms within our digital ecosystem, with the ultimate goal of determining which platforms are underutilized or driving the most engagement.

When I was exploring the data, I realized I didn't have a great mechanism for visualizing set interactions, so I started looking into [UpSet plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UpSet_Plot). I think these diagrams are a much more elegant way of visualizing overlapping sets than alternatives such as Venn and Euler diagrams. I consulted [this Medium article](https://medium.com/@narayanmahto/visualizing-intersecting-sets-upset-chart-in-python-cf72e4cad5b1) that purported to explain how to create these plots in Python, but the instructions seemed to have been ripped directly from the projects' GitHub pages, which have not been updated in several years.

[One project by Lex et. al 2014](https://upset.app/) seems to work fairly well, but it has that 'matplotlib-esque' look to it. In other words, it seems visually outdated. I like creating views with libraries like Plotly, because it has a more modern look and feel, but noticed there is no UpSet figure available in the figure factory. So, I decided to create my own.

# Introducing 'upsetty'

[upsetty](https://github.com/eskin22/upsetty) is a new Python package [available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/upsetty/) that you can use to create upset plots to visualize intersecting sets. It's built with Plotly, and you can change the formatting/color scheme to your liking.

"As a non-data-scientist, assess my approach for finding the ""most important"" columns in a dataset","I'm building a product for the video game, League of Legends, that will give players 3-6 distinct things to focus on in the game, that will increase their chances of winning the most.

For my technical background, I thought I wanted to be a data scientist, but transitioned to data engineering, so I have a very fundamental grasp of machine learning concepts. This is why I want input from all of you wonderfully smart people about the way I want to calculate these ""important"" columns.

I know that the world of explanability is still uncertain, but here is my approach:

1. I am given a dataset of matches of a single player, where each row represents the stats of this player at the end of the match. There are \~100 columns (of things like kills, assists, damage dealt, etc) after dropping the columns with any NULLS in it.
   1. There is a binary WIN column that shows whether the player won the match or not. This is the column we are most interested in
2. I train a simple tree-based model on this data, and get the list of ""feature importances"" using sklearn's `permutation_importance()` function.
   1. For some reason (maybe someone can explain), there are a large number of columns that return a ZERO feature importance after computing this.
3. This is where I do things differently: I RETRAIN the model using the same dataset, but without the columns that returned 0 importance on the last ""run""
4. I basically repeat this process until the list of feature importances doesn't contain ZERO.
   1. The end result is that there are usually 3-20 columns left (depending on the model).
5. I take the top N (haven't decided yet) columns and ""give"" them to the user to focus on in their next game

Theoretically, if ""feature importance"" really lives up to it's name, the ending model should have only the ""most important"" columns when trying to achieve a win.

I've tried using SHAP/LIME, but they were more complicated that using straight feature importance.

Like I mentioned, I don't have classical training in ML or Statistics, so all of this is stuff I tried to learn on my own at one point. I appreciate any helpful advice on if this approach makes sense/is valid. 

# The big question is: are there any problems with this approach, and are the resulting set of columns truly the ""most important?""",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/18ut4si/as_a_nondatascientist_assess_my_approach_for/
Mistake to bring up preference for ML during interview?,"I had an interview a while back with a banking company for a data scientist position. The interview was going really well - I answered their questions about model selection and evaluations proficiently and they even mentioned my proposed solution was how they solved one of their own business problems.

Toward the end of the interview I asked if their team focuses heavily on data engineering, or if there is a separate team dedicated to DE. I said that I've been in positions in the past where the company wanted a ""data scientist"" but the duties were solely focused on data governance and data pipelines with no modeling whatsoever. The interviewer told me they have a separate data engineering team and that their data science team primarily focuses on modeling.

Whats your approach when it comes to decide whether or not eliminate variables from a dataset?,"Newbie here asking for a bit of wisdom from my senior peers.

Im currently finishing my masters in Data Science and Im now working in a real project for a real company with real data. Basically the goal is to build predictive models capable of determining the properties of certain manufactured products (so its a regression problem, basically).

I have several datasets that in total represent about 250 different variables and Im doing the preliminary EDA on them before doing the actual modelling.

Im running into some categorical variables that have very low cardinality. For instance, dichotomous variables in which one of the classes is severely under represented (somewhere between 5% and less than 1% of the records).

Im trying to go into the modelling with a dataset as ""light"" as possible but I dont want to lose valuable information in the process.

So my question is what do you usually do in these cases? Do you keep them until the modelling confirms their uselesness to predict, do you delete them outright, or you decide what to do based on a preliminary analysis like a correlation or cramers V analysis of said variable in relation to the target variable(s)?

Ultimately the insights generated by the analysis are very rarely taken up by those who can make the programs better and improve millions of lives (subjectively).

[Need advice]I Want to Leave MAANG a Month After Being Hired,"(Hope this is the right subreddit as many people post job-related/job-seeking questions. If not, I'm sorry, that's an honest mistake.)

Hello everyone. I was recently hired by one of the big corporations, and I would appreciate advice from the community.

I was offered a high-level DS manager position at one of the MAANG companies. During the hiring process, I discussed with the hiring manager that I would start as an individual contributor, focusing on helping to improve the recommendation engine. Several months later, I was supposed to transition into managing a small team. I was extremely excited, it’s MAANG, after all.

However, on my very first day of the job, my manager’s peer informed me that there had been a reorg. As a result, the tasks we had initially discussed would not be happening. To make matters worse, it turned out that my manager’s planned promotion didn’t materialize, leaving no team for me to manage. I thought, “Okay, I can live with this. Worst-case scenario, I’ll transfer to another team later.”

Fast forward two weeks, and I honestly hate it. The tools we use are awful. Simple tasks that would take minutes outside of big tech now take up to an hour because our small databases constantly crash under load. Even building a basic causal model becomes incredibly challenging because we can’t extract data from the database for a sufficiently long period. When I raised these concerns with my manager, their response was, “I’m not a fan of complex modeling. If you want to do that, let’s outsource it to the Data Engineering (DE) team.”

What’s more, my daily work involves adding charts to dashboards and handling ad hoc requests from various stakeholders. Nobody can clearly state our long-term goals or what we’re trying to achieve. Our OKRs are DAU and Revenue, which are essentially driven by other company products (lol). The most disconcerting part is that every other Data Scientist in our part of the organization seems to be doing the same — ad-hocs, reports, and dashboards. Frankly, this doesn’t feel like DS work at all.

In my previous workplace, I held the responsibility of creating models and introducing new ways to leverage data to increase our KPIs. My team was first to introduce causal modeling and ML-based user segmentation, we’ve also piloted several other things that involved shipping models to production. When I decided to leave, my employer has repeated several times that should anything go wrong, I shouldn’t hesitate and come back to working for them. I’m seriously consider this option now. By the way it wasn't a small shop, that was an international company with petabytes of data and over a billion of revenue per year. Not the MAANG level though.

My current job offers better compensation, particularly if I can vest my stock options. However, during these several weeks, we’ve already experienced another reorganization (3rd or 4th in 1.5 years), making it highly unlikely that I’ll vest before the next round of layoffs.

What would be the right move? To those familiar with MAANG companies, I’d appreciate your insights. Is this situation normal?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/1buvnuw/need_advicei_want_to_leave_maang_a_month_after/

To PhD or not,"Hi everyone. I think similar questions come up somewhat frequently here but I always find them somewhat generic.

I wanted to have the sub’s opinion on whether or not a PhD is worth pursuing in my situation, given that:

* I’m a mid level data scientist in Europe working my way towards being promoted to senior in the next year or two. I work at a big tech company - not FAANG but still a well-known brand
* My goal is to continue progressing in mt career and eventually getting a job at a top tier company in terms of compensation 
* I like what I do but perhaps I would also like to transition into a research scientist position (and that’s the biggest reason for considering a PhD)
* I think I could handle doing the PhD (I was considering something related to causal inference and public policy) while continuing my regular work. And I think I could definitely do some interesting research, but my college is not a very reputable one 
* I am genuinely interested in that research topic but I think I would only put myself through that if it provides significant benefit for my career

i think i built the easiest way for python developers to interact with the cloud (and at a massive scale),"over the last 6 months I've become obsessed with the cloud abstraction space. the more I started to dig the more it made me realized that adoption has been super low... way lower than it should be. it appears that adoption has been incredibly low because the existing solutions are prohibitively complex, costly, and don't meet organizational security compliance. 

this research along with many user interviews led me to the creation of [Burla](https://www.burla.dev/). this is the world's simplest cluster compute software. it scales across thousands of computers in the cloud with no setup and one line of code.  

Burla is...

* free and open source software
* installable in your cloud with one command
* available as a managed services at 1/3 the price of other abstractions
* a python package with one function and two arguments
* a tool that just works. The developer experience is local and it re-raises exceptions and streams output locally. Packages are automatically synced, we clone your local env and then cache it.

happy to elaborate more on features in functionality, I will be releasing the open source and managed version over the next couple of weeks. I hope this is able to deliver a massive amount of value to the python community. it should be incredibly simple for all python developers irrespective of their skillset to easily leverage cloud resources.

Is it even worth it for me to try to learn new data science methodologies and techniques at this point?,"I got my MS in stats in 2020 and had about 3.5 years experience as a data analyst at that time. I wanted to break into data science, and so it being lock down and nothing else for me to do, I started teaching myself the cutting edge of the field at the time, things like neural nets and a bunch of advanced ML techniques. I did several projects on my own (no, not just titanic and mnist datasets) and created an online public portfolio. I applied to tons of data science jobs but had no luck. I've been able to increase my salary through a progression of analyst jobs, but none of them really use anything advanced. The one I was at before had a little tiny bit of clustering and FA, and maybe a basic regression model, the one I'm at now is literally all just SQL dashboarding. 

After my first move in Feb '21, I kind of just stopped trying to stay on top of the field, since I got a higher salary and I just kind of burnt out of doing so much stuff on my own to try and make myself more marketable. I just did other things with my life for a few years, but I'm feeling ready for another move now. I notice now data science positions are asking for AI, GPT4, LlaMa, and those things weren't around when I was really working on my skills. I'm willing to learn those things if there's a good chance I'll use them, but I haven't used tensorflow, keras, or sklearn at all despite sinking massive amounts of my personal time into them.

I think part of it is there seem to be no junior level data scientist roles. It seems at most places, analyst is a different career path that tops out at management instead of more advanced methodologies, and so it doesn't really get me any closer to data scientist. Most open DS positions I see are senior or even manager and so I'm nowhere near qualified for them. I'm questioning if it's even worth it for me to spend so much time trying to learn these things when the DS positions are forever out of reach, and perhaps I'm better off getting an MBA or something and trying to target leadership analyst type roles.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/1apf2gc/is_it_even_worth_it_for_me_to_try_to_learn_new/

Is DS becoming a Dev Specialty?,"I think historically DS was populated by math and statistics people. And science people. Core backgrounds were stats, physics, social sciences at the PhD level. Gradually DS has become important to business and requires deployment. Developers become DS savvy and specialties start to emerge adjacent to data scientists, meaning DevOps for AI, MLOps, Data Engineering. And of course there are FSDs, BEEs, and FEEs supporting DS work.

All this made sense to me. But now I'm seeing DS courses that just assume the audience is Devs who want to learn DS.

Data science leaders - how do you cope?,"In almost any line of work, individuals with leadership skills inevitably become less hands-on over time. This is because, according to the business, their time is better spent driving (and being accountable for) project success rather than deliverables.

Moreover, the tech changes so quickly that, without keeping a foot on the ground, it doesn’t take much to feel like things are moving on beneath you.

Why are there no good graph visualisation programs?,"Does anyone know of any half decent graph/network visualisation programs? Gephi is very frustrating to use (can only view up to 20 attribute columns at once, can't inspect node/edge attributes from the graph view, attribute values only allow you to copy the abbreviated scientific notation form etc.)

This is what I am trying to do... I have a graph (heterogenous but I can compress it to homogenous if absolutely necessary) and I want to be able to interactively visualise said graph. If I click on a node or edge, I wish to be able to see the attributes of that node or edge. Preferably, I'd also be able to colour nodes and edges by attribute.

There seems to be a few small bespoke projects but from the few I've tried, none have achieved what I have outlined above - what I would have thought to be the bare minimum for a graph visualisation application.

**EDIT**

Cytoscape standalone is definitely the way to go for me. Would highly recommend over Gephi. Still had to flatten my heterogenous graph, appending all attributes across all types, but with a specified `TYPE` attribute you can conditionally colour within Cytoscape so it gets you there in the end (bit annoying that every node/edge has redundant attributes from other node/edge types but it's not the end of the world.)

Heated debate with leadership because of Excel,"I work for a small company that deals with claims process for major insurance companies. Medical bills, car repair authorization, you got it.

I was hired to improve the data analysis area, to deliver insights for key people on the organization. SLAs control, trend lines of the customer demand to better allocate our people on days/shifts, etc.,

They gave me a blank check to do whatever I needed to. 

Seemed like a dream becaming true. No pre-requisites, full control of my work and a great opportunity to expand my portfolio.

And honestly, I delivered a great work.

But I'm facing a new and frustrating problem: people on leadership positions keeps using Excel. I saw other bosses telling their people to put data on spreadsheets, causing wrong and outdated reports for the part of the company that uses my tools properly.

And they keep asking people to create spreadsheets, when they can even export data on this format from the dashboards.

Yesterday I got on a heated debate with my boss about this. 

I need some advise. It's a nice company overall, on a industry that I know a lot (insurance is part of my academic formation) and I don't know how to handle this without putting my job at risk.

Introverted personalities in DS?,"I wanted to get some insight from any senior level managers who are in DS or anyone who made the climb from analyst to DS management. 

One of the main concerns I have regarding this in my career path, is that I’m not the most outgoing, sociable, talkative person. My background is in BS math and stats -> MS stats, and I’ve always been the quiet kid who just does the work, goes to lecture, and goes home. I am talkative with friends, but not so much people I work with. 

I think the best way to describe my personality is an academic, but doesn’t like academia, and who wants to be industry. 

I am an academic at heart and am curious and love the “geeky” subjects like math and stats and programming, and enjoy talking to people about it, but don’t want to do a PhD and want to end up in industry.

The issue with this is that I feel with my personality, I’m going to have a hard time really climbing the ladder in DS.

I could do the hard skills and technical part very well, but the people related stuff I find myself to be kind of intimidated by.

For example, in a previous internship, I had no problem taking the project my manager had for me, completing it quickly, picking up new tasks, doing those, and just getting things done. Head down doing the work, communicating with my manager, and moving on. 

However, sometimes he would say “hey I don’t think I can make this meeting with product team and marketing team, can you just talk about updates to our work here from the last few weeks?”.

Laid off data science looking for advice,"I got laid off from my data science job a month ago. The job search has been brutal. I’ve only had about four phone screens and two first round interviews after about 100 job applications. I’ve been rejected from everything and have zero leads right now.

I had my job for a little over a year, but it was not a very prominent company, so I don’t think it looks that impressive on my resume. I think I’ve done pretty well in my interviews so far so I suspect I’m being rejected due to them finding out I was laid off. If they ask about my reason for leaving my last job, what should I say? Maybe I can make something up that sounds better.

What is the easiest way to stand out? I don’t have much of a portfolio and no publications. Which projects should I work on?

Maybe we're using too much data to train models,"If you make the weak analogy between LLMs and humans / other organisms, we find that the LLMs are trained on vast amounts of data. So much so that a human being may never process that much information over their developmental years. Of course, the brain seems to be a foundation model that has been trained over all of its ascendant's data, which could be argued to be much more than all of the internet. But I don't think the information coming from our ancestors is as detailed as the information we gain from actually experiencing and learning things.

So, my shower thought was that maybe we are using way too much data to train the models. Clearly, there is enough information in much less data to gain a deep understanding of the world.

I do recognize that it's the trillion dollar question to construct a model that would need less data to develop as good of a world model as gpt4 or the other sota models.

"Statisticians in DS, how did you “connect the dots” between business skills and theory?","I’m an MS statistician whose gonna be starting a data scientist position soon. I think one of the things I’m the most confident about is my statistical analysis and overarching background I have on methods. I am fairly comfortable I can handle up to 95% of weird data sets, and know how to properly assess assumptions, critically look at data, and choose the right model or tool for the job. I’m even more confident in my ability to present and explain interpretations of results, because that’s what is also emphasized in our applied coursework. With a good background in stats, I’m fairly confident in the actual “doing” of data analysis and wrangling and what not.

But I think the part I’m not really sure about or worried I’ll be bad at is “connecting the dots” between my stats stuff and the business problem. A lot of what I’m worried about is that I can do all of this stuff to understand the data, but if I don’t even understand the context well enough, then my analysis has no path to follow. This ambiguity is something I know I’m going to struggle with, and I’m not sure how I’m going to improve in this area besides talking to more of the stakeholders.

Am I underpaid or is it ok?,"Hi, I’ve been recently wondering if I’m getting underpaid at my job or if my salary is ok.

I work as a Data Scientist at a small company in western Massachusetts, near Springfield MA. I started working here after graduating college May of 2022- my degree was in Math and Philosophy. When I started work in October 2022, I was only guaranteed 3 months at the job. I was being paid 15$ an hour for the first month (this was like a onboarding period). Then once I settled, it got increased to 18$ per hour. After the 3 months, I got a further salary bump to 24$ an hour. 

This April (6 months into the job), I negotiated my salary for a raise for the first time. Being my first ever salary negotiation, I feel like I kinda undersold myself. There was a bit of a confusion on the final agreement, but basically my salary was increased to 70k per year (33.65$ an hour).

Overall, I think this is a good salary. Especially when I look at where I was compared to where I am now, and the cost of living in this areas, there’s a lot to be thankful for. As a international student I got really lucky to find a job in the nick of time. But, I’ve done a lot of good work here - in fact I do more Data engineering and software engineering than data science, and I do everything from controls engineering to database management to software development to Statistical analysis.

Solving a real problem with your side projects,"Just thought I'd throw this out there, but I've noticed that almost all side projects have one thing in common: they don't solve a real problem and there's no reason anyone would ever actually use it.

A commom theme when someone is starting a DS side project, they start thinking about what technologies they can use, what datasets are available, what models they want to try, etc. 

What if instead, you think about the problems in your life and the things you care about. You can still keep your ML toolbox in your head, but the focus should be on making a model that someone (hopefully you) would actually want to use. 

The problem with this type of ML side project is that only 20% of the time is spent on pure ML, however that is kind of the reality of any DS position anyway. So it seems like a more fruitful exercise to building the right skills for applying ML models to generate value and solve problems.

"Spark, Dask, DuckDB, Polars: TPC-H Benchmarks at Scale","I gave this talk at PyData NYC last week. It was fun working with devs from various projects (Dask, Arrow, Polars, Spark) in the week leading up to the event. Thought I'd share a re-recording of it here

[https://youtu.be/wKH0-zs2g\_U](https://youtu.be/wKH0-zs2g_U)

This is the result of a couple weeks of work comparing large data frameworks on benchmarks ranging in size 10GB to 10TB. No project wins. It's really interesting analyzing results though.

DuckDB and Dask are the only projects that reliably finish things (although possibly Dask's success here has to do with me knowing Dask better than the others). DuckDB is way faster at small scale (along with Polars). Dask and Spark are generally more robust and performant at large scale, mostly because they're able to parallelize S3 access. Really-good-S3 access seems to be the way you win at real-world cloud performance.

Looking more deeply at Dask results, we're wildly inefficient. There's at least a 2x-5x performance increase to be had here. Given that Dask does about as well as any other project on cloud this really means that \*no one\* has optimized cloud well yet.

This talk also goes into how we attempted to address bias (super hard to do in benchmarks). We had active collaborations with Polars and Spark people (made Polars quite a bit faster during this process actually). See [https://matthewrocklin.com/biased-benchmarks.html](https://matthewrocklin.com/biased-benchmarks.html) for more thoughts.

This also shows the improvement Dask made in the last six months. Dask used to suck at benchmarks. Now it doesn't win, but reliably places among the top. This is due to ...

1. Arrow strings
2. New shuffling algorithms
3. Query optimization

There's a lot of work for projects like Dask and Polars to fix themselves up in this space. They're both moving pretty fast right now. I'm curious to see how they progress in the next few months.

For future work I'd like to expand this out a bit beyond TPC-H. TPC-H is great because they're fairly serious queries (lots of tables, lots of joins) and not micro-benchmarks. We could use broader coverage though. Any ideas?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/17qm6ob/spark_dask_duckdb_polars_tpch_benchmarks_at_scale/
Identity Crisis in Data Science,"Anyone else confused where they fit in data science? There's a huge range of backgrounds, from bootcamps to Ph.D.s. I've found DS quite unwelcoming because of this. Everyone is trying to distinguish themselves from the ""fakers,"" while most companies needs are quite basic.

I've been working on a DS master's degree for a year. I certainly know more than the typical data analyst or self-taught MOOCs student, but I'm overwhelmed by the interdisciplinary nature of the field. I've invested countless hours and thousands of dollars, yet there's a lifetime more to learn. This makes me question whether I want to continue in the field. When I talk to computer scientists, they're all very encouraging and emphasize that, although difficult, everyone can learn to code. When I talk to other data scientists, I get an air of elitism.

I think this happens because data science is a relatively new field. Other specialized skills like accounting, law, or finance have had time to settle into a list of requirements and utilize certifications where necessary. Since we have one title to describe a huge population, people end up getting defensive so they're not grouped together with the less qualified. Maybe overtime this resolves itself as data science expands into more titles. For now, I feel caught between both sides of the argument. I have no desire to get a PhD and a lot of imposter syndrome. It leaves me feeling like I should have gone MBA -> product management and called it a day.  On the flip side, when I explain basic stats at work, I'm met with blank stares, leading me to think the push for Ph.Ds is more about ego than practicality. My hope is to see clearer distinction in titles and more encouragement in the field than discouragement. 

For those of you in the middle like me, where have y'all had success? What kinds of industries, companies, or roles do you target?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/178vvrk/identity_crisis_in_data_science/
Is it normal to both lack documentation & have a hard time completing tasks without colleagues assistance as a new hire? Not sure if I'm simply not cut out for data analytics.,"Hi everyone.

So, it's been about six months since I began my first data analyst role at a massive FANG-esque company, and I'm feeling a bit defeated. Despite my efforts, I just missed another deadline. This happened partly because I lost a considerable amount of time waiting for clear answers or direction, and also because I made an error when pulling a join together correctly.

The problem is, I'm always on my own trying to figure things out when handling requests.  I come away from discussions with requestors not sure of what they want, and with zero documentation, an abundance of tables, nearly identical fields, and other complexities, I often give up trying to figure things out on my own and go directly to colleagues for direction.

My boss has been implying I should be more confident on my own at this point, so I can't help but wonder if he's right and I should be better at figuring things out on my own at this stage. I've also noticed a few colleagues who are also newer (although they have more background in data analysis) seem to be doing much better than me when it comes to working independently. They probably have 25% more requests completed than I do, with more made deadlines.

Typically, my workflow looks something like this:

1. Review the request.
2. Meet with the requestor to discuss further.
3. Explore the data and try to figure things out on my own.
4. When I get stuck for more than a few hours, I ask my colleagues to point me in the right direction (usually I try looking over different tables/fields, reviewing other analysts working, sitting on things to see if anything clicks).
5. I power through and continue working on it.
6. Once I believe I'm in a good place, I request peer review.
7. Finally, I work on finalizing and delivering the request.

Someone please give it to me straight. Is this my fault? Should I be doing better at this point? Should I spend some extra time after hours trying to learn our data infrastructure better?

I would greatly appreciate any advice or support you can all offer. Thank you all.  


Edit: Thank you all for the advice, encouragement, and kind words! It appears my hunch was correct; the challenges mostly stem from a dysfunctional work environment. Despite the struggles, I'll keep pushing forward and making the best of it.

How much time do you guys spend in PowerPoint?,"I know this question might be a bit controversial to some but lately I've found myself spending an ungodly amount of time creating slides instead of doing other tasks.

Management wants each new project or idea laid out in meticolous detail in a PowerPoint before signing off on it and granting any type of access to data. Which means I need to create some really good looking PPT decks to even get the chance to explore our available data, it's quite frustrating and I'd rather spend the time doing something else.

By detail I mean like, budget, development timeline, target audience, documentation, blabla, before I even get a chance to look at the data and determine if it's useable in the first place.

Moving to USA or Staying in UAE,"Hi Folks

I am currently working as  Senior ML Engineer on a startup in Dubai. I am 28 years old and getting 120k USD yearly. (no tax).

Actually, I am living a good life here, its close to my home country (Turkey), so I can see my family easily and we are almost in same timezone. But the quality of things we are doing here not that good, and I am not sure can I grow in my career here in long run. I don't want to move to Europe because as I can see salaries are very low . If I stay in Dubai getting a salary around 150k in 2 years in here is very doable for me now.

I started considering to move to USA. I found hybrid master programs (first year is remote second year is USA and I can OPT). So I don't have to sacrifice my 2 years to go USA. Probably I will stay without a job just one year.

Do you have any advice for me? Is moving to USA changing my lifestyle, and making sacrifices (time, masters, moving to USA, money etc) worth it?

"Data Analyst job is, well - not data analysis at all","I'm about 5 weeks into a new role with a well known nonprofit. Prior, I was working as an analyst for a mid-size retailer on their ECommerce team - I was there for a little over a year (this is my only other work experience). Now, I took this role as fully remote (last role was hybrid), and was misled quite a bit in the interview process. I was led to believe that this role was going to be a bit more on the technical side, however I'm learning that isn't the case AT ALL. 

&#x200B;

This new role contains 0 actual data analysis. For starters, I'm the only analyst for this company, so I'm kind of on my own. When I took this job, I flat out told them I was looking for something more technical - in my last role I used some SQL, PowerBI. I was really looking to expand upon that. I have quickly come to realize that the entirety of my role is just responding to tickets and using Adobe Analytics. There is quite literally zero analysis work to be done. 

&#x200B;

I'm debating just outright quitting. Nothing makes me feel like I'm in hell more than just sitting there responding to tickets all day. To be clear - I was told that what I'm doing is essentially the job - there won't be expansion into more technical areas in the future. Quite honestly, I feel like I'm regressing by being here, and I feel like my technical skills especially may regress by not being able to utilize them in any way or expand upon them. Maybe I'd focus on getting my Master's, or finding something else - but am I crazy for considering quitting when I'm confident this is a dead-end job that will likely only harm my career more than help?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/15ysbh8/data_analyst_job_is_well_not_data_analysis_at_all/

Trapped in dev job after bait-and-switch,"TL;DR: Took my first DS job, was moved to a software development team and now I'm stuck, because my current job doesn't give me the experience I need to move to the next DS gig.

So, I started my first job as a generalist DS ~1.5 yrs ago (following an unrelated PhD), but after ~6 mo, the company pulled a bait-and-switch and ""temporarily"" moved me to a software development project due to a ""shift in priorities"" and because I ""know Python"". 

Now it's been a year and I still find myself in a scrum team fixing bugs, adding features to our app or wireframing UIs. Naturally, I've been looking for a new DS position, but without much success, i.e. few take-homes or technical interviews.

The main hurdles, in my view, are that
• Interviewers get suspicious when they see that I've been at my current company for such a short amount of time,
• I've gained virtually no experience directly relevant to DS (only worked on a data pipeline / reporting project for the first few months).

To address the first issue, I usually give a canned response, when asked about my motivation to move. I would say that I've been working in a software development project because it creates the most value for the company at this time. That I really appreciate this experience because good development practices and cloud technologies are so important for modern DS workflows, but that I prefer working more hands-on with data to solve concrete problems for stakeholders. In my view, that's quite positive and logical, but maybe this could be improved?

The experience issue is harder to fix. The only way I see atm is to go back to doing personal projects and applying to entry-level jobs. Since I don't have the energy for this while working full time, I'd have to save up for a few months and then quit my current job. That carries a certain risk, but I'd bite the bullet for a chance at a job that's more up also. Is there anything I should keep in mind before I do this?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/15dzi6j/trapped_in_dev_job_after_baitandswitch/

Investing in Math Knowledge Better Than Learning Software Tooling for Career Longevity?,"Had this discussion with coworker. His advice was that time spent learning mathematics, statistics, business skills, and soft skills is key because those things are eternal. Software tools and packages are not. 

I tend to agree. I feel the focus in breaking into DS leans on the technical side (software packages, etc) instead of the more eternal mathematics. 

I tend to agree, and putting yourself in this mindset prevents the pressure to learn the flurry of trendy new tools as much.

How would you approach this interview question?,"So this was my first ""data science"" interview where I was asked (what I think) was a business case. Apparently I did soo poorly I got handed a rejection a few hours later, so I wanted to know what you guys think of this problem, how you would solve it, if it's even an appropriate DS question etc...

The problem goes something like this: You are a data scientist that works at an e-commerce platform that sells experiences at Paris (think bicycle rides, wine tours, etc...). The company doesn't own any products but rather takes a commission from every product sold.

You have access to a table of 500 such products (for Paris only) that has columns like title, category, review count, review avg, price, duration, when it was posted, etc... (maybe 2-3 more but these seem more like internal IDs that don't really matter). The three questions we went over before she gave up on me were:

1. How would you pick 1-2 metrics from this column to sort these listings? (To build a quick formula for ranking these listings)
2. What are some disadvantages of this approach?
3. How would you predict that the rankings will change in 6 months from today (assuming I implemented my strategy)?

My answers where:

1. I would pick the review avg and count. normalize the count, like minmax so that it is in the same range as the review avg, and weight the review count and review avg by a alpha and (1 - alpha) for example. Should have I picked price instead of review count? I didn't because I would assume that the revenue generated per product would be somewhat similar (I also asked how they take commission and the answer I got was to use price as the proxy for commission which imo makes no sense, the rates wouldn't be the same for all of the prices right?), otherwise they would not have signed that product plus, for longer term growth I would assume UX would be more important that money generated short term, i.e. recommend things that the user would like more... should have I used the inverse of the review count to treat this problem more like a multi armed bandit with the UCB strategy?
2. I said that this approach wouldn't give a higher ranking to newer products and that it would be more dificult for these new products to rank
3. I pretty much said the same as 2. because I also gave up around here

The questions I have are: why ask a question that doesn't allow me to use ML? I understand having a baseline, but still... I briefly mentioned multi armed bandits and she overlooked what I said. If this was a business case why didn't I get more context? I asked what was the bigger context, if this was for a ranking algorithm, and got a not very convincing ""sure"" (tbh using the term ""sort"" here somewhat confused me, I usually see the term ""ranking"" for these problems, it looked like she was avoiding it for some reason). I then asked what was their current approach for sorting these listings and she didn't answer...",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/1b853sy/how_would_you_approach_this_interview_question/

Basically I find the work pretty boring. It’s hybrid work and a lot of the time I goof off at home and just put in the actual hours when I’m in the office. I basically say to myself over and over that I don’t know why I would bust my ass to make my CEO more money. A lot of the work I find to be a huge waste of time. I was previously in the military so I really understand bullshit projects and time wasting but it feels different on the civilian side I guess. 

I really don’t know if the data science world is for me. Do you find the work rewarding in other fields? Basically I really do find data science interesting and I know I have a LOT more to learn but most of the jobs seem to be in banking, finance etc. I basically am just working to make some other dude more money and that just bugs me.

What does it mean to work with ETL/ELT in the industry? Practical examples?,"I have been trying to learn more about the concept of ETL. However everywhere that I search about this topic, I am presented with very generic theoretical information about it.

Is this all there is to this topic? From what I understand, ETL is about extracting data from a source like a data warehouse, transform into something like a business need by conditional filtering, etc, and then have it loaded somewhere for a business to be readily available, and then create some kind of pipeline to automate these processes.

Is this all there is to ETL? Am I missing something crucial? Are there specific software/platforms that allow the creations of ETL pipelines?

I think if I could get some kind of real life example of what ETL is, it would help with my understanding. Like a batchjob querying a database, then transforming it into a data frame with a R or Python script, and loading it to a BI dashboard?

U.S. Hiring Managers: how diverse is your applicant pool?,"We are currently hiring for a mid-level DS and by my last check, we got a few hundred applicants, about 80-90% of whom were not US citizens or foreign nationals.

Firstly, I don't have a problem with this. My parents are immigrants and our team would never discriminate against any applicant based on race, culture, or even English proficiency. We are screening very fine applicants from China, India, Turkey, etc.

That said, I do wonder where all the native English-speaking American data scientists are at?

Data Science Salary vs GDP per Capita,"Naturally, GDP per capita has a strong correlation with the salary of any profession, including Data Scientists. It is interesting to see, however, which countries pay more than expected based on GDP. The United States not only pays the highest, but it seems to pay way more than the GDP would predict. My interpretation is that this is due to the many successful global companies in the US, which means that a single hour of DS work scales across many more users comparatively to average companies in other countries.

The basis for this chart are the predictions from the data science salary prediction model, performed only once for a given set of job's features (across all possible combinations of the job's features), to avoid the common mistake of just taking the average salary in the dataset for the analysis.

How should data science employees be evaluated?,"It is known that most of the data science initiatives fail. For most companies, the return on investment for data science teams is far lesser than a team of data analysts and data engineers working on a business problem. In some orgs, data scientists are now being seen as resource hoggers, some of who have extremely high salaries but haven't delivered anything worthwhile to make a business impact or even to support a business decision.

Other than a few organizations that have been successful in hiring the right talent and also fostering the right ecosystem for data science to flourish, it seems that most companies still lack data maturity. While all of the companies seem to have a ""vision"" to be data-driven, very few of them have an actual plan. In such organisations,  the leadership themselves do not know what problems they want to solve with data science. For the management it is an exercise to have a ""led a data team"" tag in their career profiles. 

The expectation is for the data scientists to find the problems themselves and solve them. Almost everytime, without a proper manager or an SME, the data scientists fail to grasp the business case correctly. Lack of business acumen and the pressure of leadership expectations to deliver on their skillsets, makes them model the problems incorrectly. They end up building low confidence solutions that stakeholders hardly use. Businesses then either go back to their trusted analysts for solutions or convert the data scientists into analysts to get the job done. 

The data scientists are expected to deliver business value, not PPTs and POCs, for the salary they get paid. And if they fail to justify their salaries, it becomes difficult for businesses to keep paying them. When push comes to shove, they're shown the door. 

Data scientists, who were once thought of as strategic hirings, are now slowly becoming expendables. And this isn't because of the market conditions. It is primarily because of the ROI of data scientists compared to other tech roles. And no, a PhD alone does not generate any business value, neither does leetcode grinding, nor does an all-green github profile of ready-made projects from an online certification course the employee completed to become job ready. 

But here's the problem for someone who has to balance between business requirements and a technical team - when evaluated on the basis of value generated, it does not bode well with the data science community in company, who feel that data science is primarily a research job and data scientists should be paid for only research, irrespective of the financial and productivity outcomes.

In such a scenario, how should a data scientist be evaluated for performance?

"Didn't get the job at an interview because of ""Mistakes made"" but can't find them.","Hi, 2 YOE Data Scientist here, with Engineering Background.

I was doing a interview for a start-up in Paris. The project was looking great, the interviewer, a Talent Acquisition girl, was really nice.

At the end of the interview, she asked me 4 theoretical questions, in vocal, no notes or time to think.

*1) I throw a coin, call X the random variable of the result, which can take x=0 if heads and x=1 if tails. What is the mathematical law X follows ?*

My answer : Uniform law, with probability of p=1/n => p=1/2 here.

&#x200B;

*2) Now I call Y the random variable counting the number of times I get heads. What is the mathematical law Y follows ?*

My answer : Binomial law => succession of experiences with 2 outcomes.

&#x200B;

*3) You have a dataset with equal amounts of pictures of cats, dogs, and a third categories with all but cats and dogs, all in quantity sufficient to prevent issues. We build a model achieving 95% precision. But, when entering production, the precision collapses to 60%. What do you do to fix this ?*

My answer : I would take the data from production, and analyse both training and production datasets to look for statistical differences, labelization mistakes, or any property which could explain a difference (example : maybe all cats and dogs are black in the training one ?). I would also check the capacity of the model, look for any underfitting or overfitting issue, by looking at the loss of the model on seen and unseen data.  I would also make sure data was shuffled properly, just in case.

Other things to do would be to check confusion matrixes to help identify the cases of the errors.

*4) Give me key indicators of performance in data science.*

For neural networks construction, training precision/loss, validation precision/loss, testing precision/loss, but also statistical indicators like RSE, RMSE, MAPE... and the dozen of similar metrics. Each of those metrics have different use case, for example RMSE is good for low values in dataset, but bad for high values or outliers.

&#x200B;

4 days later, I received an email telling eventhough the interview was pleasant and my career impressive, I made mistakes on those questions which made them decide to not continue the hiring process with me. I was very surprised, and still can't fully understand which answers were wrong. It's very frustrating because it's very hard to get any interview for junior datascientists positions where I am, such opportunities are rare. I want to understand my mistakes and improve to not let this happen again. Can you guys give me your opinions on this ?

Thanks in advance !  


EDIT : Thanks a lot for all your feedback. I have now a clearer picture on how I could improve things. More perspective, double check basics, and be more interactive with the interviewer, going more in depth.

My experience transitioning from full-time to freelancing,"I was scrolling through this sub yesterday and saw a couple of posts related to what i recently went through - lay offs and freelancing. so thought i'd create a separate detailed post on how i got started freelancing and why not get back into FTE (if interested, see related post back in Jan just after getting laid off- [https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ivzyj/my\_ds\_experience\_at\_amazon/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ivzyj/my_ds_experience_at_amazon/)).

Anyway, after my last FT job at Amazon, and having the luxury of not needing to jump back into the job market immediately, I had to choose between getting back to stable employment or exploring few things i had wanted to try out for a while now- freelancing and learning web development.

Even with FTE, I had tried working on side projects on evenings/weekends after regular work hours, but with Amazon, ""regular work hours"" is a blurry line. and my projects never really got anywhere. January was also the time when chatGPT was getting popular and I had been playing around with chat-with-your-data apps using the openai LLMs. So on a whim, even before deciding anything, I created an Upwork profile. Mostly, I wanted to prove to myself that i could make money if i needed to without selling away all my time to a company.

I reached out to a couple of folks on Upwork who needed help with AI chatbots, and to my surprise, within a couple of weeks, i had my first freelancing gig and soon after (thanks to the upwork algorithm), started getting jobs in my inbox. So much so that I could select what jobs i wanted to work on. Just last week, I declined a $10k contract offer just for the first phase as the client had been dragging their feet since March with ""approvals"" and the scope was unclear. I had to remind myself that i didn't want to get into another long contract which would effectively be full time employment.

Since Feb, I have made $15k on Upwork without really 'applying' for any of them (all inbound requests), while being highly selective on how much time i freelance and what kind of work i want to do. I know $15k is nothing to brag about compared to a salary, but I share this as someone who 4 months back, thought freelancing was a non-option for me. To the person who asked about this yesterday, it's very doable.

So what have I been doing with the rest of my time? Spending time with my now 6-month son, traveling, and learning web development. Work-wise, I wanted to reconnect with fellow data scientists, so tried running a data science mentoring/mock interview group here but that never really took off ([https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10uy2qi/starting\_a\_personalized\_mentorship\_group\_for\_data/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10uy2qi/starting_a_personalized_mentorship_group_for_data/)).  So instead, I combined it with my other interest to learn web development and have built a data science mock interview app - [rightjoin.co](https://rightjoin.co). here is a short blurb-

* get mock interviewed with an AI hiring manager for any company/job post/topic of choice. Warm up for your upcoming interview with questions tailored to the job posting/topic.
* you can upload your resume and have your AI persona answer questions for you. so you get to observe how your chatGPT-version would answer questions.
* get feedback on each response to the interviewer questions

Its currently a ""phone-screen"" level interview, but i plan adding other types of interview rounds if people find this useful. And its free. please try out and let me know what you think, especially if you have an upcoming interview. here's a screenshot:

For me, it's been fun dabbling with web development (django, htmx), keeping up with AI wave, having the freedom to spend time with family when i feel like, and learn things that interest me. I know this may not be sustainable, but I do plan to ramp up freelancing later this year if needed to stress test that option, and only in the worst case, jump back into the job market.

I understand, these options may not be viable for others, but if you do find yourself having to make additional income with freelancing or want to try out solopreneurship, it's possible. Obviously there is risk involved but also ways to manage that risk until your build your portfolio a little. the AI wave has made this easier than otherwise, but as a data scientist, why wouldn't you jump on this wave?

DS Professionalism: Notebook best practices,"We all know that in general notebooks are the standard for many data science teams and that they can lead to bad practise (notebooks that can’t be run top to bottom, functions that change definition etc.).


Are there any resources for what best design practice looks like for notebook lead DS for the sake of clear and repeatable analysis/modeling. 


For example:

1. Should non-package functions be defined in notebooks or imported from a separate .py.

2. Handling data imports (all at the top or only for each separate piece of analysis)

3. When to separate notebooks (eg for a model training task would you have data pulling, cleaning, validation, hyper parameter tuning, final training, out-of-sample checks all in one notebook or a folder that contains X ordered notebooks to do those tasks.)



The obvious answer is “do what your team does”, but in case you are in charge of practise or there is no design doc for the team are there good defaults.

Importance of CS fundamentals for data science roles in tech,"How important are computer science (CS) fundamentals to data science roles   at tech companies? And how central are they to the application  process?

Tech companies like  Google, Meta, and Amazon offer public resources to help  job candidates understand work life and required skills. These resources  often  describe cross-functional teams of engineers, data scientists,  etc.  Advertised roles like ""machine learning engineer"" also seem to  inhabit  the gray area between software development engineer (SDE) and  data  scientist. Of course, these companies offer tech products at huge scale, and at least for SDEs, CS knowledge is a focus.

However,   many data science learning materials focus on the math and techniques for analyzing data and building models, with programming as essentially a  means to those ends.

As  someone  interested in exploring tech, I am wondering if formal study of  data  structures, algorithms, computational complexity, etc., should be  a  bigger part of my diet.

I appreciate your answers. It's helpful to know your connection to this topic too (e.g., recruiter, team member, fellow candidate).

**EDIT:** I take it for granted that folks need to know how to write maintainable code and use programing tools like git, unit tests, etc. By CS fundamentals I am thinking of concepts or design patterns that enable software to scale efficiently. Thanks for clarifying questions.

**UPDATE:** Thanks for all the input. To summarize several great comments drawing from individual professional experience:

> Data Scientists (DS) and ML Engineers (MLE) need different skills; generally these roles are not interchangeable. Large companies may be able to specialize so that DS focus on models and collaborate with MLE for scaling. Smaller companies may have more generalists. CS knowledge requirements may also vary by different areas of a company (e.g., product vs engineering).
>
> A DS with CS knowledge may collaborate better and enjoy more career mobility. However, entry level DS can generally begin with rudimentary CS knowledge and grow on the job.

Couple follow-ups for those who want more:

- The hiring guides I mention focus more on SDE. Seen any good ones for DS?
- I feel like I see more MLE than DS reqs. How does demand compare?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/17qql6b/importance_of_cs_fundamentals_for_data_science/

"Where to go after studying the foundations of linear algebra, calculus, probability theory and statistics?","So Ihave been studying these topics for 4.5 months, using a mix of Pearson's Jon Krohn's live lessions and bluebrown channel on YouTube.

Where should I go now? I asked 6 months ago about a book here called hands on machine learning. Read it and got to work with sklearn on supervised learning problems at work (I am a sales operations analyst with 1.5 years of experience and another year of internships in multiple companies as a data analyst)

What model should I use? Predicting if a client would like a song or not.,"Hi all,

I changed some details to make the question clearer, but it goes as follows:

Client enter our website, we have all kind of features (browser, language, age, location, etc.), and we present them with a song. There are currently 10 songs in our system to choose from. They can either click ""like"", ""dislike"" or not give feedback at all.

The goal is to maximize the probability that a client would enjoy the song, by matching a song based on the info we have on the user (the features I mentioned before).

Intuitively I was thinking of a multiclass classifier, but I have only like/dislike (or no feedback) for one song per user (assume I don't know who the user is, I treat each observation as independent).

Another way is to create an XGBOOST for each one of the 10 songs, and in real-time choose the song with the highest prediction. It'd work but it sounds ""dumb"", as there is a much better, known way, to deal with it. Is that correct?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/15i6i1u/what_model_should_i_use_predicting_if_a_client/

Accepted into UCSD’s Masters of Data Science!,"Really excited for this opportunity! Of all the programs I got accepted to, this felt like the best one for me :)

This really feels good especially considering I flunked out of grad school the first time I tried going from 2015-2017.

UPDATE: it’s been almost a year since I made this post and a few people have reached out about the program so I thought I’d make an update. 

I did not end up enrolling in the program. I enrolled in WGU’s Master of Data Analytics program. Say what you will about competency based education, but the application process was free and was easy to complete. I applied in September and enrolled on 10/1/23. I graduated earlier this month with a 30 day extension given to me since I was in my final capstone course.

I now have a masters that only cost a total of $4,470, took 6 months to finish, and helped me land my current position 3 months ago which was a big step up for me. It’s already paid itself off so I’m super happy with my choice. I also have close to a decade of work experience in the data field so at this point all I needed was that piece of paper saying I had a masters. After listing my masters as “in progress” on my resume I started getting a ton of interview opportunities and went multiple rounds with 3 employers, got 2 offers, and settled on the best one before the 3rd one could get back to me.

What realistically is a good alternative take-home assignments?,"Everyone in this sub seems to absolutely hate take-home assignments. I used to find it stupid as well until I was involved in a hiring process a few months back.

We were hiring for a junior to mid level DS position, it only took a couple of days to gather half a thousand applications. (It’s absolutely insane, maybe due to the job being remote) Even after filtering out those with quantitative degrees or relevant experience, we still had to deal with slightly over 100 candidates. Interview all of them is definitely out of the question here.

The process we had was to get them do a coding test. Easy to medium leetcode questions with some SQL questions. Of the 2/3 that passed, we send them an assignment with one week deadline. Once submitted, they get a zoom interview to present their work. Here’s the thing, **take-home assignments work.** It very effectively cut down the number of applicants to around 10. 

I understand it’s not fun doing these assignments, but given the job market, what’s a good alternative that helps you filter among 100s of qualified candidates on paper, and also help you understand how they do their work and communicate? DS resumes these days all look the same. Everyone claims to know everything with no proof of proficiency. Recruiting is very time consuming and costly, and the cost of hiring a fraud DS costs even more.

Some argue that assignments will deter the best candidates from continuing the application. The reality is that, unless it’s meta or google, employers are not obsessed with finding the best person out of hundreds of candidates. They just want to find someone who is **good enough** to perform certain tasks without adding burden to the team. 

So for those really hates take-home assignments, if you’re in the position of hiring, how will you evaluate your applicants?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/18aif1a/what_realistically_is_a_good_alternative_takehome/

My job is producing loads of charts for Powerpoint...,"I've started a new job in a industry company. 

Basically, my department does market analysis. They've been doing it for years and everything is a big Excel file. Everything is excel and kind of a mess. For more info about the context, here the [episode 1](https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1271cb2/new_job_as_a_data_manager_the_data_is_a_bunch_of/) of my adventures.

So, I've had to build from scratch some kind of data *stack*. Currently it is :

* A postgresql database
* Jupyter environment

To be honest, I was skeptical about Jupyter because it shouldn't be a production jack-of-all-trades-data-tools. But so far so good.

I'm fairly experienced in SQL, Python (for data analysis: pandas, numpy). 

Here is my question. A huge part of the job is producing charts and graphs and so on. **The most typical case is producing one chart and doing 10 variations of it**. Basically for each business line. So, it's just a matter a filtering there and there and that's it. 

Before, everything was done in Excel. And kind of a pain, because you had a bunch of sheets and pivot tables and then the charts. You clicked update and everything went to shit because Excel freaks out if the context moves a tiny bit, etc. It was almost impossible to maintain consistency with colors, etc. So... not ideal. And on top of that, people had to draw by hand square and things on top of the charts because there are no ways to do it in Excel.

My solution for that is... Doing it in Python... And I don't know if it's a good idea. I'm self taught and has no idea if there are more proper way to produce charts for print/presentations. Main motivation was: ""I can get Python working fast, I really want to practice it more""

My approach is:

- If I have to produce a report, that is like 30 charts and they all have 5 variations. I build a notebook for this purpose. 
- In the notebook I try to make everything nice and tidy by using parameters and functions a lot (and comments, and text blocks with explanations for future-me). I try to pull data once (SQL) and keep it as a dataframe, manipulate it with Pandas and do the chart with Matplotlib. Each chart is a function and variations are handled by passing a parameters. And styling, etc. Is done by calling a module I've made.

For example, I want to produce the the bar chart `P3G2_B1`. It's the Graph #2 on page #3 for Business line #1. 

I call the function `P3G2()` with B1 as parameters and it produces the desired chart. With proper styling (Title, proper stylesheet, and a footer mentioning the chart id and the date). It's saved as a SVG (P3G2_B1.svg) and later converted to .EMF (because my company uses an old version of PPT that doesn't support SVG.

So far, what is good about this approach :

- The charts look nice and are very visually consistent. Matplotlib allows me to specify a lot of things so there are few surprises.
- It's fast enough. Doing an update and outputing 50 charts is a matter of minutes.

What I'm not too happy about :

- Matplotlib makes me miserable. I'm still learning Python and everything is painful. I find matplotlib confusing as hell. There are multiples and wildly different ways to do anything. Half of my days are just googling ""How to so <insert weird request> in matplotlib"". I've tried seaborn, plain pandas, and so on that are supposed to be *easier* than pure matplotlib. Well, I end up having to do something weird and having to sprinkle it with plain old matplotlib regardless. So I've decided to just go with it.
- Matplotlib to do print is quite awful. My powerpoint slides have a grid, and let's say I want to create a bar chart that is 8 by 6 on this grid. So I expect a 800x600 pixels image. Not. so. easy. (especially since I need space for title and footer around the chart). What you see and not always what you get (through savefig, as an image file). My module handles that mostly OK but it's very hacky and still a mess. And also, the .svg to .emf conversion is another layer of pain. Some graphical things don't convert well (hatches for example).
- Some charts functions are more than 100 hundreds lines of code. It scares me a bit. I have a hard time convincing people that it is better than Excel. They just see a house of cards waiting to fall.

So. Given the assignment, am I crazy to go with Python notebooks?

* Current systems can’t scale, be extended and are narrow in scope. They are badly engineered.
* Because of the above, I am building a scalable system, step by step
* I have some questions about how best to do it

# My current thinking and the state of the project

&#x200B;

* Should I create a formal scale of usability of the AI projects? I am looking for your input here.
* I think I should improve model consistency, extends the model with custom domain knowledge, and make an early attempt to build simple user agents in the domain. Backend + API? SNS/SQS + API+ Backend\*
* What I have is a schema inference, contracting basics, and a way to structure unstructured data. *Ideas on structuring data contracts? Schema evolution?*
* I’m about to create a memory component that manages the data stored in vector DBs, as a DWH for AI.
* If I bring this use case that was not something available easily to the public before, how best do it?

I would love to get your feedback!

I was upset about the role but my boss assured me there were “big things” in the pipeline.

Interestingly, my manager and other colleagues don't seem to share the same level of concern as I do. They are more inclined to continue the project and generate ""output"". Their primary worried about what to delivery to CIO.

First job fresh out of Uni and none of my skills can be used,"So I just graduated from University 2 months ago, and focused on building my skills in data science taking the required courses in Statistics, Machine Learning, Biologically Inspired Computations, and am decent in using Python, SQL, R. With the mindset of breaking into the industry as an Analyst, I spent the entire of the last semester and these two months job hunting. Was met with countless rejections and failed interviews and finally landed a role at a startup as a Data Analyst.

The company had actually just started operations 6 months prior, so I did not have much data to work with. Essentially, most of my time was spent in doing data entry, cleaning their excel sheets, updating their CRM with the cleaned data and creating some Power BI reports. I was recently browsing on LinkedIn and came across Data Analyst Job postings with descriptions that talked about skills in building data pipelines, bringing together data in a data warehouse, manipulating datasets in production environments, technologies and dbs such as Snowplow, MongoDB, PostgreSQL and Neo4j, and just felt so inadequate. Not only do I have no idea where to start, I am also losing knowledge of the ML, Statistics and coding skills I had in college. I do not have any senior at work who has done anything remotely in my field to seek advice from, and just answer to the Business Manager.

Are there any books, websites, YouTube channels, or courses I could pursue in my weekends or free time to learn and develop these skills? I am very thankful I even have a job in this environment, but I fear being behind my peers and having no technical skills in the future at this rate. I don't even mind starting from the very beginning (How to be a Data Analyst/ Data Scientist? Learning Statistics from the basics, etc etc.) to polish my knowledge of this field. I just wanna be in a position where I can vouch for myself and my knowledge when leaving this company for a more competitive environment that actually matches DS.

- Develop some magical AI that solves all our business problems using all sorts of buzzwords we hear in the news
- Develop LLMs that has nothing to do with the business
- There are cavern walls in Africa with cravings by Neanderthals containing cleaner data than the database

Requirements: 
- 2 PhDs
- Published 7 first author papers in top journals
- Won 5 Kaggle competitions simultaneously with one model

**2. The ML engineer**
Description: 
- Literally everything from data eng to MLOps to cloud infra, except actual data science
- “End-to-end ML pipeline”
- If you use a for loop with pandas data frame, they will bring you to the back alley and shoot you in the head

Requirements: 
- Solve hard leetcode question blindfolded with one arm behind your back
- Need to know 17 ways to accomplish the exact same thing using AWS/GCP
- Need to know 5 different databases we don’t even use

**3. The mislabelled data analyst**
Description: 
- Nothing but making dashboards
- Use statistics but not too much that it gives our execs imposter syndrome
- ML, but it’s logistic regression on Excel

Requirements: 
- Tableau etc
- Telepathic ability to magically make business people understand basic statistics concepts 
- Willing to be called incompetent by exec when your analysis shows the source of all business problems stemmed from poor management by said exec

I enjoy the work a lot but it almost feels pointless — my KPIs aren’t and never have been aligned with what I do and think is actually important to the business, however seems the business understands this as I’ve never had an issue.

What I’ve practically achieved:
The code runs more than 5000x faster than when I took it over (true fact) and the website isn’t broken.

What I’ve clocked up in KPIs:
All the incremental uplifts I’ve developed will be rendered insignificant every year when an unforeseen outside factor changes the business substantially.

Starting my own analytics engineering team- give up or die trying?,"I'm currently a year into being a part of a small analytics team at a large and antiquated retail company. My manager and teammates are completely business-facing with minimal technical knowledge. Speaking to some higher ups and other functional teams, I realize there's a huge cap in data needs and people who can manage simple data workflow, such as getting the data, cleaning & exporting it, and creating dashboards.

Our leadership is not open to hiring additional senior level data folks, so I guess it's up to me to do the job if I choose to. My question is, is it worth the effort to start my own team and build an entire infrastructure from the ground up? (vs. simply find a new job with modern data culture) Currently, all of the raw data are in Excel/CSV. I've helped them automated all of the data transformation steps with Python and built some nifty dashboards for our stakeholders. 

What would be the tools & costs associated with building a completely new infra?

Stuff I can think of: (we're of course a MS Windows shop)

* A database (ex. MS SQL server on Azure)
* An orchestrating tool (Airflow/Prefect)
* Github
* Tableau (we already have)
* Additional headcount (I will be a one-man team to start. I don't have huge ambitions to be a people manager.

"The search for intellectual stimulation in DS jobs, should I just give up?","I’m an MS student in statistics. My undergrad was in mathematics and statistics. I have done a few data science internships in undergrad. These were analytics jobs, and, frankly, I shared the same sentiment with a lot of people here about them being dull, boring, and not challenging. 

The rigor of my undergraduate and graduate degree made me search for jobs that were just as rigorous, and, I was surprised after a few of these internships that, this is just how the industry is.

I felt very lost in my career search despite having the technical background. I considered various career paths

 (quant finance), can’t get an interview unless I got a top Ivy League degree and get screened out regardless of my credentials. 

(Machine learning engineer) I have no software engineering experience, and seeing as my prior experience is data analysis tools like R and python I haven’t gotten any interviews for this since I just don’t fit the description of a software engineer (which is what they seem to want for these roles)


(PhD in Statistics) this is not a career path obviously, but, I figured well, maybe I should apply to phd programs and just do academic research. I get the rigor from undergrad (and more) plus working on technical and challenging research problems. And of course having a PhD can open more doors. But the thing holding me back for this is I’m graduating from my MS at 24 years old, and by the time I finish a PhD I’d be 29-30. Put a lot of my life on hold, and frankly, as much as I thought research is interesting and I love statistical theory, I’m just not a huge fan of the academic lifestyle and reminds me of school.



I reached out to one of my former managers at a prior data science internship. He did his BS in mathematics and MS in economics and went from modeling roles -> analytics. 

I asked him why he did this, and why he didn’t wish to stay in the technical role he was in at first. 

What he told me frankly shocked me. He said that at his company 

- modelers have worse work life balance than data scientists in analytics

- data scientists in analytics have much higher pay than modelers do to them being closer to the business 


He told me that ultimately the WLB and higher pay is what motivated him to go to analytics. He told me a job is a job at the end of the day, and he couldn’t justify doing more technical work for less pay. 

So I guess I wanted to ask you guys, even if some of you guys don’t enjoy your SQL/Tableau analytics jobs. Do you still stick around cause of the high pay?

After graduation, I got a pretty good DS job for a consulting company and it’s been great, but with time, I would like to use my domain knowledge and move back into the energy sector for which as of right now, I’m too inexperienced in the ways of DS..

Are there any experienced data scientist in the energy sector willing to give me some advice on what to focus on and what are the main and most sought after skills in this sector right now? I would really appreaciate it!",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/1bd2oh6/data_science_in_the_energy_sector/
"As a new grad, is getting a masters an inevitability that I need to plan around","As a new grad, is getting a masters an inevitability that I need to plan for

As a new grad, can someone clarify just how necessary a masters is and should I start planning to get one now?

Graduating this May with a Bachelors in Applied Math from a top 10 university. Degree has been pretty much the intro math stuff (Calc2&3, Linear Algebra) the 2 first years and Stats/CS/mathematical modeling last 2 years. I have a job lined up already as an L2 analyst at a company I’ve been interning at for the past 2 years. 

I’ve been researching around for more info on just how necessary a masters is in the field and if it’s something I’m going to eventually need to bite the bullet on. Currently, as I understand it, people tend to get caught up in chasing data scientist as a title (which is inherently a senior position) when analyst positions are the more entry level roles. So is it reasonable to assume that analyst for a few years -> DS is a valid path or would I still eventually run into that wall of needing an advanced degree no matter what?

I don’t really want to go through the process of getting a masters. I’m lucky enough to be graduating with no debt and am not really eager to voluntarily get it. The idea of taking 2 years off from making money is not very attractive as well. Also, part of me is just talking as a senior who’s tired of school so there’s that.

Do data scientists need domain knowledge?,"What's your opinion? Can data science work be outsourced to people that do not have domain knowledge? Does having an intermediary translating the requirements to the outsourced teams help? If yes, then to what extent? What are some drawbacks?

EDIT: I couldn't agree more with comments reinforcing the need of domain knowledge. I myself would not hire an experienced DS nor a DA without domain knowledge, despite all their flashy online certificates and degrees. I think I owe a context here for asking the above question:  There have been ongoing discussions in my org where a senior leader is pushing for outsourcing the DS work to a team working on a service based model (you'd be surprised how many such providers are just rebranded/repurposed IT firms, especially in India), irrespective of whether they have domain specific knowledge or not.  Their idea is to bring in intermediaries to do the translation of business needs. Some of the teams who've been in the org for a long time see this as only an image building exercise of creating a new verticle. To shut the naysayers' mouths they've hired DS consultants to do the talking on a technical front. The consultants have surprisingly agreed to the idea of isolating DS from the business knowlwedge which made me question ~~reality~~ if anything has changed in the DS world with regards to domain knowledge  requirements.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/1aechbq/do_data_scientists_need_domain_knowledge/
"Laid off, being offered a contracting position, need advice","Last Friday I was laid off on a group call with 5 other people. I worked for a small company and they basically ran out of money and are shutting down our entire half of the business besides 2-3 people (almost 30 people were laid off I believe).

An hour after the call, my boss called me (he’s been there for 25 years and is staying) saying that he has no one else who can handle large data sets and he didn’t know what he would do if they received customer leads and needed data help. I was the only person doing analytics on the entire team. He said they are now going to offer me a contracting position to help as needed. 

What can I expect from the contracting offer? Any advice on whether to accept it or not, or a threshold at which I should accept/deny?

Also, I have two previous bosses from this company and both were able to set up interviews for me at their current companies. I had an initial screen at the first one yesterday and it seemed horrendous - I would really prefer not to work there but I know I can’t be picky. The guy was demeaning (“why did you choose to go for your master’s in analytics?” - as if he didn’t even understand what analytics is), but said if he decides to take a certain project, I would be a good fit. I’m more hopeful for the second company as it seems like a less toxic environment and I have specific experience in that industry, but I don’t have an interview scheduled there yet.

I feel lost, displaced, upset, and have not heard back from a single application I’ve put out (not surprising, I know the market is insane). Any advice is greatly appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/18c5bjn/laid_off_being_offered_a_contracting_position/

Glass ceiling for data science careers?,"I am working with many data scientists in a large international enterprise, many of them have a PhD in fields such as physics, maths or computer science.

Recently, I started wondering if there exists an unspoken glass ceiling for data scientists (or IT specialists in general) in many organisations for such individuals who are not overly keen on giving up actual hands-on data science work, or who are not overly keen on having lunches and coffees with more senior managers all the time. This might sound like a luxury problem to have, but once you are beyond your 40s and have a family, it's not so much fun to be put in front of an undisclosed choice to either not progress anymore significantly or be forced to become a manager and give up that which you are really good at. Obviously, one could argue that many data scientists, to progress further, need to learn how to be more outgoing, extrovert, present themselves etc. - but that's not what I'm referring to. I've seen brilliant people leave the company because there was just not a lot more possible for the positions they were in.

Why can't I transform a distribution by deducting one from all counts?," Suppose I have records of the number of fishes that each fisherman caught from a particular lake within the year. The distribution peaks at count = 1 (i.e. most fishermen caught just one fish from the lake in the year), tapers off after that, and has a long right-tail (a very small number of fishermen caught over 100 fishes).

Such a data could possibly fit either a Poisson Distribution or a Negative Binomial Distribution. However, both of these distributions have a non-zero probability at count = 0, whereas for our data, fishermen who caught no fishes were not captured as a data point.

Why is it not correct to transform our original data by just deducting 1 from all counts, and therefore shifting our distribution to the left by 1 such that there is now a non-zero probability at count = 0?

(Context: this question came up to me during an interview for a data science job. The interviewer asked me how to deal with the non-zero probability at count = 0 for poisson or negative binomial distribution, and I suggested transforming the data by deducting 1 from all counts which apparently was wrong. I think the correct answer to how to deal with the absence of count = 0 is to use a zero-trauncated distribution instead)",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/18p8uz5/why_cant_i_transform_a_distribution_by_deducting/

It seems like they're doing more than just guessing the next word.

What do I do next?,"Every data scientist I’ve talked to has told me that I have all the makings of a data scientist - the tech foundations + communication skills. A BS in mathematics from a top school (including advanced statistics and coding courses like C++), ~10 years of teaching experience, aced every boot camp project, and now have ~3 years of experience as a Data Analyst. 

A former recruiter now in HR at a tech company was supposed to give me advice after a resume review, and said that she has no advice because I’m a great candidate. 

However, the only job I could get recently is an hourly job - Excel pivot tables, and using a BI reporting tool. No real data work.

It is difficult enough to land any interviews at all rn, but then you have to deal with the recruiters who cannot even do their jobs. I recently had a negative experience with Capital One for a data science position. Details are below:

* I was reached out by a recruiter from C1 about 2 weeks ago, asking for my availability for a 30 mins interview. I responded within that day my availability for that week and the week after.
* Recruiter responded 5 days later, agreeing to schedule a call at 3PM the day after
* The day after, recruiter sent me an email right before the call, saying that he needed to push back the call to the next day. I agreed and provided him with my availability for that day. Recruiter did not send any confirmation response.
* The day after that, recruiter emailed me at 2:40PM, asking me if he could call at 3PM. I was in a meeting at the time, but still agreed to take the call and left the meeting early.
* Recruiter never called at 3PM. He sent an email at 4:30PM stating that “something came up that was very time-sensitive,” without any apology, and offered to reschedule for 6 PM that day or the next day. Again, I replied with an agreement to take the call at 6PM
* Recruiter never called at 6PM.
* The next day, I sent another email to recruiter, but this time, I copied Capital One's main careers/HR email address. He called me within a minute after I sent the email (lol).
* The call lasted for 5 mins, for what was supposed to be a 30 mins call. He asked me basic questions like salary expectations, and relocation. I was not even asked ""Do you have any other questions about this role?""
* Recruiter said he would forward my resume to 2 hiring managers, and would let me know what they think. I asked for the hiring manager's names, and he said he would send me their linkedin profiles in a follow-up email.
* Of course, I never received this follow-up email. I sent him an email asking for the hiring managers' contact info. He never replied.
* Early morning the next day, I received a rejection email. Mind you, our call was around 5PM the previous day. This made me wonder whether my resume was ever forwarded to the hiring managers at all.

TL,DR: Was flaked on 3 times by C1's recruiter. Finally got a super brief call because I copied the main HR email address in the chain. Got rejected the next day.

What do you think I should have done differently in this process? Also, I was thinking about sending a feedback for this process to the main HR address, but not sure if this would be the right move?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/12nzf5c/how_do_you_deal_with_flaky_recruiters/

However, part of me feels “weird” that my education is gonna stop at 24 and I will be working and not getting another degree. But that’s besides the point. My real concern is whether I need to plan on getting some kind of “professional” degree after my MS in Stats. When I interviewed for a role the hiring manager (who had no background in anything stem) told me I should consider an MBA to round myself out. Frankly I have no interest in doing an MBA. I’ve gone debt free for my education my whole life (thank you parents for bachelors, and thank you to myself for getting funding for my masters), but in no way do I want to pay for an MBA. 

From my limited experience it feels like MBAs are just degrees people get to prove to a higher up that they have the credential to get a c suite position. Cause ultimately people hire people and if the directors or c suites have MBAs they know if they have an MBA from xyz university then they are gonna get hired cause of it.

How to validate data?,"I'm an SWE (**not a data scientist**) and trying to build a generic data validation tool (or find appropriate tools to adopt) for my company.

I started looking into libraries such as Great Expectations, Pydantic, etc.. And they all seem promising, but I don't think they solve the issue of validating *changes in data* (as far as I can tell). They seem to be good at validating that data is within an expected range, of an expected type, etc., but I need a little more.

What I'm looking for is a tool that validates changes in data by comparing the previous value with the new value.

In some of our applications, new data is first pumped into a staging table. We then calculate relative change % between the staging and target table (for each field), and if the change is higher than some threshold, validation fails. But there's obviously a lot of issues with this (like in cases where a change from 1 to 18 is normal but produces a percent change of 1700).

This is just an example, but it would be helpful if we can call an API to do this sort of validation for us.

And instead of using absolute change, relative change, etc... is there perhaps a tool that can validate based on historical changes? Perhaps by capturing changes for some set time and using that information to validate future changes? I'm just brainstorming here.

Feature Selection from 300+ features,"Hi, I have a dataset with 80k+ rows and 300+ columns. Its a tabular data set and is a regression problem. It takes historic data and performances to predict the outcome. Though the original features are only about 50-70, I have a good understanding of the features and know they could be broken down a lot better to help the algorithm ( Xgboost most probably) give better results by creating new features. So i did a lot of feature creation, ratios, multiplications, ^ and so on. I feel like there could be unimportant features but there are some combinations which could really help my model.

There could be a mix of linear and non linear features, features having the same latent concepts as well. There are many ways like using tree based models, feature importance, neural nets, mutual info, correlation, RFE, selectkbest, information gain , forward and backward selection and many more. 

But, im confused because for eg, trees and neural nets can sometimes ignore a lot of the more nuanced features and go for the more obvious relationships and even thyre non linear, we dont have to remove the colinear features we might still get a case where the similar features will steal each other’s importance.

I'm getting bored of plotly and the usual options. Is there anything new and fancy?,"I was pretty excited to use plotly for the first year or two.  I had been using either matplotlib (ugh) or ggplot, and it was exciting to include some interactivity to my plots which I hadn't been able to before.  

But as some time has passed, I find the syntax cumbersome without any real improvements, and the plots look ugly out-of-the-box.  The colors are too ""primary"", the control box gets in the way, selecting fields on the legend is usually impractical, and it's always zooming in when I don't intend to.  Yes, these things can be changed, but it's just not an inspiring or elegant package.  

ggplot is still elegant to me and I enjoy using it, but it doesn't seem to be adding any features for interactivity or even tooltips which is disappointing.  

I sometimes get the itch to learn D3.js  [D3 by Observable | The JavaScript library for bespoke data visualization (d3js.org)](https://d3js.org/) or echarts  [Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) .  The plots look amazing and a whole level above anything I've seen for R or Py, but when I look at the examples, it's staggering how many lines of JS code it takes to make a single plot, and I'm sure it's a headache to link it together with R / Py.  

Am I missing anything?  Does anyone else feel the same way?  Did anyone take the plunge into data viz with JS?  How did it work out?

How do you propose controlled experiments at work?,"Hello. I've just started my first job in the data world. One of my main task will be to propose and report the results of A/B tests / experiments. This is a small fintech that leases laptops to undergraduate students and the whole process of application, approval/rejection, payments, etc. is online. Internally, everything is pretty new and there's a lot of room for improvement because all internal processes are pretty manual.

I am very excited about this challenge because I feel it gives me a lot of room to be curious and to think outside the box, but at the same time I know that it lends itself to being very convincing and being able to convince my bosses that it is worth the time, effort and perhaps money to do each experiment, with the risk of not getting any interesting results.

how can I build a regression model which is penalised for moving away from an assumed set of coefficients?,"So I've a glm currently live, and i'm looking to refresh this model on latest data to capture any major drift in trends. I'm looking for a way of refreshing this model, but with a penalty factor included so that the fit is strongly discouraged from moving a coefficient, unless there's a clear gain to it (in other words, the model shouldn't pick up very minor variations, and certainly shouldn't flip signs of coefficients due to any correlation in the input data for example). Ideally the strength of the penalty should be a parameter the user can fiddle with to decide a best model.

&#x200B;

I have a number of ideas of how to do this: 

bayesian regression, with priors set to be equal to the original model coefs  ( think this will be too slow on large datasets though) 

Custom loss function, with a penalisation parameter similar to lasso regression which penalises a value different from the live model parameter (this will require a fair bit of coding and testing to get right though)

My main issue  is time constraints, so I'm wondering what the best out of the box tool i could use to achieve any of these, or if anyone knows of a simpler way of solving the problem.

Help with Multiple Linear Regression for product cannibalization.,"I briefly studied this in college, and chat gpt has been very helpful, but I’m completely out of my depth and could really use your help. 

 We’re a master distributor that sells to all major US retailers. 

I’m trying to figure out if a new product is cannibalizing the sales of a very similar product. 

I’m using multiple linear regression. 

Is this the wrong approach entirely?

Data base: Walmart year- Week as integer (higher means more recent), Units Sold Old Product , Avg. Price of old product, Total Points of Sale of Old Product where new product has been introduced to adjust for more/less distribution, and finally, unit sales of new product. 

So everything is aggregated at a weekly level, and at a product level. I’m not sure if I need to create dummy variables for the week of the year.

The points of sale are also aggregated to show total points of sale per week instead of having the sales per store per week. Should I create dummy variables for this as well?

I’m analyzing only the stores where the new product has been introduced. Is this wrong?

I’m normalizing all of the independent variables, is this wrong? Should I normalize everything? Or nothing?

My R^2 is about 15-30% which is what’s freaking me out.  I’m about to just admit defeat because the statistical “tests” chatgpt recommended all indicate linear regression just aint it bud. 

The coefficients make sense (more price less sales), more points of sale more sales, more sale of new product less sale of old.

My understanding is that the tests are measuring how well it’s forecasting sales, but for my case I simply need to analyze the historical relationship between the variables. Is this the right way of looking at it? 

Edit: Just ran mode with no normalization and got an R2 of 51%. I think Chat Gpt started smoking something along the process that just ruined the entire code. Product doesn’t seem to be cannibalizing, seems just extremely price sensitive.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/1but6uu/help_with_multiple_linear_regression_for_product/

Tips for communicating with non-technical stakeholders,"I think it’s fair to say that one of the key aspects of a lot (most) DA/DS roles is the ability to communicating results and technical ideas with non-technical stakeholders. 

I’m really interested to know what everybody here thinks that actually means in practice.

To me, it means:

* When presenting (e.g. slides), using concise key points, and graphs/charts that aren’t overwhelming, keep different colours to a minimum etc.

* Using language which adds more “relatability”. So rather than saying e.g. “17% of people”, saying “around 1 in 6 people”

* When talking about “raw data”, I like to be very clear about what each row represents in the context of what I’m looking at. Related to this - when you’ve aggregated or processed data, show an example of the raw data prior to aggregating to demonstrate exactly what you’ve done, to add context.

* Don’t say “we fit a linear regression model to the data by solving for the coefficients which minimise sum of the squared residuals” - instead, put it in plain English,  say “this is a mathematical model which predicts the value of Y based on X. We have used the data to determine the slope and intercept of a line which best fits the data”

How many of you do not use A/B testing in your jobs?,Am I the only one?,https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/15odbqj/how_many_of_you_do_not_use_ab_testing_in_your_jobs/
Job offer (mini rant),"Hi people of reddit,

I have been looking for a job as a Data Scientist for the last year or so. In the meantime, I have been taking up some freelance work and classes on the side (dataquest, datacamp) to improve my skills.

For context, I am a Mathematician, and graduated from my Ph.D. a few years back. I finished my post-doc last August. I know how to write code in R, SQL and Python, and I am confident (most of the time) in my ability to learn. I am very familiar with statistical concepts (although I did not specialise in it) and I have exposure to ML algorithms. Over the last year or so, I have applied for over 500 roles, getting into \~50 interviews. In the end, I got exactly 2 offers, one of which I accepted a few days ago.

I have to say that this last year has been crappy (to say the least). Every company boasts about its inclusivity plan, which (don't get me wrong) is very much needed. However, my point here is that people with a background in academia are generally, and from my own experience, not included at all.

Some doctorate programmes have seminars that aim to ease the hypothetical transition to the industry, while, in truth it should be the other way around. As a former academic, I do not seek favourable treatment, not at all (and if I come off as such, it is a mistake that is solely on me). I do not expect people to rely on the fact that I have degrees and hire me immediately. I understand that it's a ""tough market"" and a ""numbers' game"". I just have to say that it feels that all the weight is put on work experience, while in truth it is perhaps an overrated characteristic.

I should not have to prove my ability to learn, adapt and apply. I should not have to prove my ability to mentally keep up with all kidns of hardship, from day one, all the way to graduation. I should not have to prove how adaptable and resilient people from academia are. I should not have to prove my ability to juggle dozens of responsibilities, all at once; nor my capacity to manage time, under a constant schedule made of deadlines. Are those not important anymore? Are those not crucial elements, honed through years of work experience?

Employers seem to care more about people using software A, rather software B and that's all it takes to get your application rejected. And here I am, thinking that they'd care about problem-solving (the big picture).

IMHO, I should not get rejected because I do not have 3 years of experience for a junior data analyst position (true story).

To finish up, I was lucky, finding a job, even after 1 year of search. Excuse the emotional take; I am genuinely curious to see if more people see my point of view.

Cheers.

**EDIT**: Wow! I never expected to have 100 comments to read/reply to. Hence, I feel obliged to provide a few clarification points:

* I did my PhD, not in order to improve my CV, or land my DS dream job.  I did my PhD because I wanted to explore my craft, as much as I could.
* I read quite a few valuable comments, and, to the people that took time to write them, thanks!
* I want to say that, sincerely, I do not think that my PhD alone makes me better than other candidates. I even highlighted that take in my post. Naturally, I do feel I need to prove my worth, I know that. It is something that traditionally comes after 1-2 interviews, maybe in the form of a take-home task, or live coding session. What is the main point of my rant, is that my ""success rate"", defining ""success"" as ""invited for an interview"" is \~1%, which, to me, is absurd.
* Kudos to u/dfphd for expressing myself better than I did:  ""*why is it that hiring managers assume that someone with regular work experience has these attributes, while not giving someone in academia the same credit?*"" is the main question I have.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/15h58oo/job_offer_mini_rant/

How does model monitoring work in a proper tech company?,"I might join a proper tech company soon. They’re big on monitoring models and engineering as well

Other than tracking distributional shifts in the features, how does model monitoring work for classifiers and regressors? 

I ask because in order to know a model is performing worse, you need new labels right? Like how would I know the precision or AUC ROC or AUC PR or RMSE is declining for a model in production unless new labels are in the pipeline and the model runs inference on newly labeled data?

Is it generally the case that models are built in areas where you can in fact get some sort of automated and periodically new set of labels?

When I interned at big tech, we labeled a certain search query as type A because the user clicked through and clicked a button that is a strong signal for type A actions. Basically we had a decent signal to label some queries in a somewhat automated way. Not all queries that were Type A were followed through with that button click though. Which is why I guess we built a model to try to generalize queries into Type A or not, even when no button clicking followed — we just had a set of queries where we were confident represented the positive class and marked everything else as not Type A

Any help here on how people generally label data and think about model monitoring in classical ML would be greatly appreciated",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/1alwf27/how_does_model_monitoring_work_in_a_proper_tech/

Data Science academic papers?,"Hello all. 

I recently made a career switch into data science, coming from an engineering background. I find myself proficient in the programming aspects thanks to my previous experience. However, I've noticed that I still have some ground to cover in terms of the theoretical aspects, especially in comparison to my awesome colleagues.

I've gone through several books, but they often either oversimplify concepts or get lost in mathematical demonstrations that I'm not interested in. I discussed this with my boss, and he recommended reading academic papers on data science and machine learning as a potential solution.

Coincidentally, I came across an article ([**https://medium.com/geekculture/how-to-become-very-good-at-machine-learning-a78e3d93fe96**](https://medium.com/geekculture/how-to-become-very-good-at-machine-learning-a78e3d93fe96)) that suggests the same approach and it strongly resonates with me, so I've decided to give it a try.

To begin this new ""project"", I want to select 5 or 6 data science and machine learning papers that are relevant to daily tasks in the field. These papers don't necessarily have to be the most recent ones; my goal is for them to offer valuable insights and practical knowledge to help me in my tasks but also as an exercise for me to slowly getting used to this kind of academic writing.

So it would be great to hear your suggestions on what these initial papers could be!! Also feel free to comment on the whole idea itself, if you feel you'd have interesting suggestions to make.

Research or software development,"Dear hive mind, I'm in the fortunate position to have offers for two positions. They pay both basically the same however
1. Position 1 is in a large, multinational company which is currently modernizing it's product portfolio and invests heavily in research and development, where I would work on ML models for all sorts of products. I would be required to be at the office about 50% of the time and attendance is tracked using some app. The tech stack is somewhat out of date but modernizing it would be part of my tasks. Here I could learn a lot about several different domains of machine learning and data science. 
2. Position 2 is at a former startup which was recently bought by a larger company. I would have 100% wfh and a very modern tech stack, however my work would focus strongly on a very narrow range of models which are interesting to one single industry. However, this company is basically a software company so that I could learn a lot about software development and ML engineering. 

So what position would you take? I tend towards position 1 because I liked doing research at university (did my PhD in math) but position 2 seems to have better benefits and engineering is interesting as well? Also I think the skills I learn at position 1 are more valuable when switching jobs again, but I'm not sure about that. 

What would be the key factors you are looking for when considering a new position?

Should I attempt to do machine learning project without business need,"   
I have an incompetent data science manager and an organization that is very low on data science expertise. They have hired many data scientists and promoted numerous database engineers and analysts to data science roles. Management only wants to hear about how machine learning can save money and refuses to consider the challenges involved. We have a fraud and counterfeit problem. The directive we receive is, ""Hey, data scientists and AI experts, we know machine learning can be used for fraud detection, so save us X millions of dollars using machine learning."" However, when we investigate closely, we find many discrepancies. The only commonality between the types of fraud in our organization and the types of fraud where machine learning is successfully used is the word ""fraud."" The manager either doesn't understand or doesn't want to understand. This has been happening for close to three years (even before I joined the company). It's a large organization with data scattered everywhere and many quality issues. We also don't receive many requirements from the business. I'm used to receiving a business requirement and then working with the business to determine if there's a machine learning use case, and then proceeding from there, justifying each step. However, the manager wants us to randomly come up with a use case and then go and talk to stakeholders. Does that ever work in a large organization? Most of the time, we don't even get a reply from them because they are too busy. It's even difficult to determine what is worth working on without involving the business from the beginning. The business is going to be the ultimate entity that implements our solution, so how can we do it without getting buy-in upfront? Do you have any experience navigating this kind of situation?

How much time do you spend on dependency management?,"After several years working with the typical Python data stack (numpy, sklearn, pytorch, etc.), I've learned that I need to create a separate environment for each project to keep my mental sanity.

However, it surprises me that many data practitioners don't do this. Many colleagues have a gigantic virtual environment for all their projects and often struggle to install new packages.

On the other side, I've heard people say that while this is a problem, it's not a frequent problem since they primarily work with the same packages, so when issues arise, they set a new environment.

Am I overreacting? Do you spend too much time struggling to install Python packages?

Is the job just meetings and meetings?,"I have been fortunate enough to recently find a DS position, and this is my first full-time job and I've been over the moon about the whole thing, but I'm quite surprised with what the everyday job is like. It's hard to escape all the ads of the data science bootcamps, and their antics about picking a random dataset and doing manipulations and transformations on them, and then just fitting an ML model on it. So this is what I thought I would be doing everyday.

However, the job I have is full of meetings, and the coding part is not even a quarter of what I was expecting. Rather I find myself in more and more and more and more meetings one after the other where the architecture or data quality aspect is discussed, or how the data is not delivering results and such. My organization recently even hired an outside consultancy to improve their in-house revenue management system. This really surprised me because the organizations has maths PhDs in its team, and this could have been done by them, but I guess this is where the DS and ML engineers jobs are different. We recently had a big meeting where DSs from other locations also flew in, and all of them were freakin' Masters or PhDs in maths, and followed the same routine.

I wanted to ask you guys, is this your everyday as well? At the same time, I also tell myself that this is a DS job, not software dev where I would be coding everyday.

"High scoring training set, but low scoring with cross-validation. Is this from overfitting?","I'm fairly new to working with this type of problem and am hoping to get some advice beyond what I was able to find from searching online.  I'm modeling on a large dataset using random forest. I get strong evaluation scores (R-squared of \~0.85) on a preliminary run on the training set with no hyperparameter tuning, however, when I introduce cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, I end up with something like 0.20 for my best model. 

My guess is that this indicates overfitting, but are there any other issues that I may be concerned with? My understanding is that overfitting is much less common in random forest models-- with my dataset being pretty large, would this just indicate that the data are highly noisy? Is there a 'best approach' to assessing/solving this issue?

Insulting promotion or should I be thankful?,"Last year I set a goal for myself that I wanted to get a promotion at the end of 2023. I aimed to expand my responsibilities and visibility, and improve the overall quality and impact of my work. Come year-end review time I was really proud of what I had accomplished, so I requested a promotion from data scientist to Senior data scientist. Fast forward a month and a half, I was just told that I’ve been given the promotion. My peer and manager reviews were excellent and the company wanted to reward me with the promotion. Directly upwards, from P2 to P3. Pretty straightforward.

I’ve never received a straight promotion before, I was expecting it to come with a significant pay raise as well, ~10-15% maybe if a standard raise without a promotion is a few percent? Not too sure. So I got my reward letter: it’s a 6% raise.

Was I delusional? Is a double digit raise for a promotion just crazy? Or should I be concerned that the company’s actions aren’t lining up with their words? What’s a reasonable raise for a promotion to senior data scientist? In this economy should I just be thankful for not being laid off and keep quiet?

How to be a better data scientist and catch up faster with smarter colleagues?,"It is very clear to me that I am one of the least competent data scientists at my company, if not the one (For context, I have worked here for 1 year, having worked 2 years before as a DA), but I know it is not simply a matter of imposter syndrome. 

When I was hired as a JDS, most of my colleagues were data analysts and my responsibilities were mostly similar to theirs (basically SQL and BI), I think I did an okay job and managed to get a promotion to regular DS. Things changed, and I was moved to a team of experienced DSs. There I will be expected to do much less data analysis and more development. Now I noticed the big skill gap and how undeserving I was of my promotion. I am extremely intimidated by my colleagues' large knowledge of our codebase (and of theory in general), and by their awareness of recent relevant papers. I also suck at networking and have a very poor knowledge of who knows/does what in the company, which everyone else seems to do well. I also don't have great presentation skills, mostly due to my lack of knowledge and subsequent insecurity. 

I know that I need to catch up, but I don't really understand how. I try to pay a lot of attention to everything that is written or said in meetings, but that almost never makes sense to me as I don't have the context. I also can never add to any meeting unless we are discussing something very close to what I have worked on. At this point, I feel super ashamed as I need to take care of one specific model that I know almost anything about. Its performance is bad and I can't figure out how to start. I am supposed at least to diagnose the model's failures but I have way too little knowledge to even figure out what to do. I could follow someone's instructions well if I had them. But as a DS I should be able to do that by myself. I know very well that working with smarter people is great for my career and that I shouldn't listen to my inner voice that tells me I should have stayed a DA. Still, I feel that I don't have the behavioral skills to take advantage of that the best way as I am introverted and have ADHD.   


I identified that my lack of attention is an issue and I am making a conscious effort to pay more attention. I am quite self-conscious and afraid of making questions, which is something I am trying to change, but at a big effort to me.

Thoughts on negotiating title change to data scientist?,"I'd like to solicit some advice on asking for a title change from data analyst to data scientist. 

For background, I have about 4 years out of undergrad, with three of those being directly in an analyst or BI developer position. I did a lot of bouncing around admittedly, dealing with some of my own issues with imposter syndrome and figuring out what I really enjoy doing. 

However, I've been at my current company for a year I'm very happy with what I'm doing. I get to do predictive modeling, more in-depth stats work than I've done in the past, and basically everything I do is in Python or SQL. Because of this, combined with wanting to continue down this path and to not get stuck in BI again down the line, I think I might be able to make the case that what I'm doing is more ""data science"" work rather than ""data analyst"" work. I'm also about halfway to my MS in data science.

Considering all this, I hit my 1-year mark in a month or two and I'm thinking about asking for this title change. Does that seem reasonable?

Why do we use multiple neurons in hidden layer for a simple ANN?,"When we have such a simple neural network, where we have all neurons of the hidden layer, receiving exactly the same input and the same number of inputs (nth features), from the previous layer.

Prospects for a (very computational) STEM PhD in FAANG?,"Hey folks, 

&#x200B;

Last spring I completed a PhD in computational astrophysics - I don't want to go into too much detail as my field is small, but my thesis subject was a monte carlo simulation that I wrote which generated and analyzed many PB of data (yes, I realize that sounds ridiculous - it was ridiculous and it required several supercomputers and a few millions of core hours). The sim was in c++ and most mathematical analysis was written from scratch in c/c++. I'm now about a year into a postdoc which is focused on subject matter very closely related to my thesis work, and also dealing with very large and complex data sets. 

&#x200B;

I have come to realize recently that I'm satisfied with my contributions to science, and I am unsatisfied with how financially far behind I am relative to most people my age (lot of student debt, no retirement, no racecar, etc.).  I'm ready to move on. In addition to my very unique computational and data management/analysis experience, I have some light ML experience and worked for a few years as a SWE for a DoD contractor (prior to grad school). I do not have SQL experience, and my python game is meh but getting better.

&#x200B;

I know FAANG is notoriously hard to break into - anyone here made the transition from hardcore computational STEM to FAANG DS, or any other very high paying DS role? Is it realistic to pursue research based ML roles with only minor past ML experience given my rather unique skills/experience?

In my case, I’ve recently graduated with a social science degree and have been advancing my knowledge in statistics to apply for these positions. I’ve done one project in the past and plan to finish a certificate this month. My only sense of career guidance has been what I’ve seen online. Data events aren’t really catered to newcomers in my area and rejected job applications are the only type of feedback I get.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/16unmxh/is_data_analytics_not_entry_level/

I just landed a job at a federal government and started a week ago. To my surprise, the job description is different from my supervisor told me. He said I will be a data engineer/architect and started asking me about experience with python, R, Tableau and databases.

Realistically, how long will it take me to adequately understand the fundamentals of the job? What resources should I use for my learning path?

Anyone gone back for a PhD in statistics after being in industry? [Q],"Was networking these past few weeks at a company career panel for the place I was interning at this summer. Two people had similar backgrounds to me (BS statistics). They ended up talking about how they progressed at the company starting out, the overall tasks they had, and what they were doing now as they have progressed. Both graduated school in 2015.

Both of them talked about their entry level data science job, as follows:

“Panelist 2 and I were both hired here at the consulting firm, and at the time another consultant was starting a “AI Transformative Technologies lab” that was just in its infancy. As fresh graduates, with out backgrounds we got by far our dream job. Panelist 2 and I were basically, from 8-5 everyday, were printing out stacks of deep learning papers, and building industry specific case studies for deep learning. In consulting, you often have many different clients for different industries, so we spent just everyday, building out a portfolio of case studies where we applied SOTA deep learning models, and pitched them to clients in each industry. Overall a dream job where we combined deep learning research with client facing presentations”.

All in all, sounded like a dream job to me. Both of them worked 9 years, doing this, and then when I talked to them after, they both mentioned how they were now heading back to academia to do a PhD in statistics and the other a PhD in CS. At 31 years old, they are leaving this job, because they had moved up to a management level, and wanted to get back into deep learning again, and felt that academia and doing a PhD was where they felt they could succeed. 

I tell this story because sometimes I’ve thought about this. I have an MS, but I know after a few years I’m gonna miss the theoretical stuff I did in my MS, and will probably considering doing a PhD just for that. But something about that doesn’t seem right. It feels that my motivation to go back to do a PhD is to “learn more advanced stats” so I can get away from managerial positions. Cause truthfully, I just don’t really care about managing people, owning a product, or any of the corporate political BS that comes with moving up in a company. 

Has anyone else done a similar route to what those two panelists did? How has it been for you? What was that transition like? Do you regret it?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/15jqlaa/anyone_gone_back_for_a_phd_in_statistics_after/
Rant - I feel like the nature of DS work is becoming less and less creative.,"Some backgroud - I've been working for ~15 years in various modeling related roles (statistical programmer/research scientist/xyz analyst/DS). Lately I feel increasingly disheartened about the type of work I'm asked to do, as well as the quality of work in data science generally. 

When I first started, to build a good model, whether predictive or inferential, I'd do research into the domain, come up with my own mental models and hypotheses of what actually shapes the behavior of your dependent variable, then knit together different quantitative methods to formalize the knowledge into a testable model. I had a lot of freedom over the ""backend"", and could build a custom tech stack and data pipeline tailored for the specific needs of the project.

Nowadays, with the dominance of GBDT and DL for predictive modeling, nothing really matters except scale, resources, and computing power. Optimization and compatability are all important so everyone ends up using the same models, the same tech, the same ""mlops"" frameworks. My previous job was working on an ASR model for a voice assistant at a big tech, which sounds cool to a lot of people, but in reality the actual work consisted of editing config files and making minor optimizations to different parameters. The only work that ever required brainpower was engineering work, not modeling work. I work at a much smaller company now but still, everything is about prebuilt tools and prebuilt models and prebuilt architectures.

Inferential analytics can still be fun, but it's increasingly rare with more business activity shifting online and thus A/B tests increasingly common. Plus, the quality/time bar on these projects keeps dropping - frankly because many new DS hires have limited knowledge/care about anything that's not ML, and will churn out very low quality output for analytics work. And increasingly I see people pumping out fishy analytics models just to get results that align with management/executive expectations. 

Anyone feel similarly? Or am I just having an ""old many yells at cloud"" moment?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/151r5sx/rant_i_feel_like_the_nature_of_ds_work_is/
"For deep learning practitioners in industry, is the workflow always this annoying? [Q]","Right now I’m working on a multivariate time series classification problem for a lab I’m working at. The training set is a multivariate time series with data collected over minutely level. Each time series is a type of positional tracking measurement. The goal is to classify each of the time series and see if they can discriminate between 3 different types of outcomes of interest. The labels are 0,1,2.

I’m doing this in PyTorch, and I read roughly 8-9 papers. They all seem to point to convolutional neural networks as a starting point. After building the model and setting up the training loops, this whole process feels like maybe 1% model building and 99% debugging, tuning, architecture changing, and tensor shape checking.

My day to day has just been stepping through my architecture with a debugger to fix bugs I’m getting during training, such as tensor mismatches, floating point error, and tuning of hyper parameters to mitigate the low test errors. 

Don’t even get me started on the runtime. I tweak one or two parameters, wait like 10 minutes, then check the results. Rinse and repeat. Now I’ve realized that my data representation is probably not correct and have to redo everything. Half the time is spent getting the data to be appropriately be shaped correctly so the network is doing stuff correctly. 

I thought I’d want a career in building deep learning models in the industry, but honestly, idk at this point after this project. It feels less of model building and more of model debugging. Half the stuff I’m doing feels arbitrary. Tweak a kernel size to this, make the number filters to that. See what happens and pray the accuracy is higher.

I actually felt more aware of what I was doing with data when I was previously doing work on Bayesian hierarchical models in Stan. Made so much sense. You write out the model, specify the prior and likelihoods, make any transformations if you need be, and then draw samples from posterior. Making distributional assumptions just made me feel like I knew what I was doing. 

With this deep learning project, it feels like 60% I know what’s going on because of the papers, 30% I can do because of domain knowledge of the dataset, and 10% I have no clue what’s going on and how parameters are affecting the model. I just tweaked the number of filters from 10, 12, and voila! A boost in accuracy by 10%. But no explanation for why.

[Q] - What is the best way to find the direction and contribution of each feature when doing a regression using Random Forest?,"I work as a beginner data scientist in a startup where I don't have any expert in the field to rely on.  


At the moment, I am working on project for a big customer and they are asking how each of their operational metrics affect one important metric, let's call it ""y"".  


They would like to get the individual contribution of each feature  in terms of % increase or decrease of ""y"". For instance, the best way would be to have a linear regression where each coefficient has a weight with it's corresponding variation YoY and when you multiply them together and sum the percentage contribution you get the variation of ""y"" YoY.  


I have tried so many things:  
\- tried linear regression (fitted many models and chose the best using the R squared adjusted, but the model was predicting an increase of ""y"" instead of a decrease)  
\- tried to fit Random Forest and SVR then tried to use SHAP and LIME to interpret the predictions. LIME is not stable and doesn't give a coherent story, while SHAP doesn't give a convincing story. For instance, it says that one of the variable positively affects ""y"" while physically it doesn't make sense.  
\- I would like to take the causal route and try to understand how each variable are intertwined but I don't have the subject matter knowledge required to do it.

how do I politely ask the head of the department to cancel the daily meetings routine?,"First, I am adding the great thread from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/y3ty7k/what_are_your_thoughts_on_a_daily_standup/) about daily meetings for DS teams.

Daily meetings are used for data scientists to briefly summarize what they did, well, in the last day. As mentioned in the first thread, it should not be longer than 90 sec per person, in some of the companies it is called stand-up meeting and it is done literally while standing in order to make it quick.

However, I still have a few problems with it. Some context - I am a team lead in a mainly remote position.

Our head of the department treats it as a place to mingle and get updated with everyone, that is, a mixture between a professional meeting and a social event. It usually makes this meeting being 25-30 minutes.

It seems that the team members join only because they must. They don't participate in a conversation, they don't exchange ideas, and basically just wait for the meeting to end. My head of the department, on the other side, is a big talker, and usually at the end of the daily starts with a five-seven minutes monologue about what he is going to do, what he did, and usually it is the same stuff that he already went over yesterday.

Moreover, and sorry in advance for my French, it is the first meeting in the morning, so after one has their coffee and would prefer a silent morning/a meeting with the toilet, we have to nod for 30 minutes.

Lastly, and most importantly, things in DS are moving slowly. Not everyday we have things to update about. I have meetings with my team members every two days, which are profound, we brainstorm and derive tasks. This is the place where I track their progress and give them feedback. I don't need to see them every day (unless they need me).

&#x200B;

I would like to ask my manager (head of) to make the daily meetings actually twice/three times a week, and instead, I will brief him myself, on 1on1, even on a daily for just the management.

Anyone here quit their job in DS to travel for an extended time (3-12 months)... then managed to land a job when you're back?,"I am planning to quit my job as a Data Science consultant (more Data Analytics tbh) soon. Since I was in secondary school, I have been wanting to take a gap year. During uni breaks/summer holidays, I''ve always done some kind of internship or work shadowing  before eventually working full time right after uni (I was lucky to find a job within one month of graduating). I've never really took a long break.

At the moment, I'm likely to go with 6 months of travelling rather than a year as I'm afraid of being out of a job for too long and it ruining my career prospects. I'm fortunate enough to have money to sustain myself for a year without pay though, including any emergencies.

My biggest worry is being able to land a job when I'm back.. I have been wanting to leave consulting for a while now, so my goal is to secure a data role that is 'good enough' in an industry. For the past few months, I've been passively applying for jobs and going for interviews, but I feel that the market is definitely still bad. Not sure if this helps, but I'm based in London.

Will Data Science stop being a plan-B for generalist PhD holders?,"With the advent of more and more dedicated advanced Data Science degrees, will PhD holders in ""general"" (non DS/ML/CS) areas stop being hired as DSs in the next few years?

Given the list of requirements I've seen on job listings, it appears that the times in which PhDs were hired due to their skills to learn and think analytically outside the box (if this ever was really a thing), are far in the past. It looks to me that, currently, even for entry-level jobs, the market favors people with the full stack of specific technical skills plus experience already under their arms. Put another way, freshly graduated PhDs are just not adecquate for entry-level jobs.

Apologies if the question isn't very well formulated. For context, I've noticed that some friends who recently finished their PhD (say math or physics) and are currently looking for DS roles, are pretty much being ignored by recruiters. What I'd like to understand is if this responds to global factors where everyone is being treated ""equally"" in difficult times, or if having a generalist PhD by itself is never gonna cut it again (if ever).

1. Drop the feature altogether
2. Drop the rows where the feature is missing (losing about 20% of my dataset)
3. Replace the na's with the most commonly occurring category

My team is familiar with LaTeX, and I am currently thinking about including Overleaf in our workflows to encourage some rigour and proper documentation.

If I get a masters, do you think I'd get closer to that goal or would it be better to continue self-studying and just apply the models/new training in my daily life? My goal here is to do more fulfilling work.

Business case without data to analyze,"Hi everyone, I have an upcoming business case interview, I have one week to prepare and provide the presentation.

The odd thing is that the 'business case' is two questions that I need to answer, however, the tricky part is, I have **not received** any data sets or anything to analyze.

I suppose I'm expected to retrieve data online to answer the questions and provide a solution that is both strategic and logical.

Anyone else that had experience with a similar situation and that can provide some tips on what to focus?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/144f7fy/business_case_without_data_to_analyze/
Time estimation in projects,"I'm a data scientist in a technology consultancy. We get asked to put time estimates on projects. The clients are charged based on those estimates.

So those time estimates almost always go wrong.

How do you learn about new analyses to apply to a situation?,"**Situation:** 2022, joined a consumer product team in FAANG. 1B+ users. Didn't have a good mental model for how to evaluate user success so was looking at in-product metrics like task completion. Eventually came across an article about **daily retention curves** and it opened my mind to a new way to analyze user metrics. Super insightful, and I've been the voice of retention on the team since. 

**Problem:** With analytics and DS, I don't know what I don't know until I learn about it. But I don't have a good model for learning expect for reading a ton online. Analytics, especially statistics, is not always intuitive and finding a new way to look at data can sometimes open your mind. 

**My question:** How do you discover what analyses to apply to a situation? Is it still mostly tribal knowledge? Your education background? Or is there some resource out there that you refer to? Interested in the community's process here.

Tech Skill Insights,"This sub has been nice to me so I am back and bring gifts to you. I created an automated tech skills report that updates several times a day. This is a deep yet manageable dive into the U.S. tech job market; the report currently has no analog that I know of.

The nutshell: tech jobs are scraped from Indeed, a transformer-based pipeline extracts skills and classifies the jobs, and Power BI presents the visualizations. 

Notable changes from the report I shared a few months back are:

* Skills have a custom fuzzy match to resolve their canonical form
* Years of experience is pulled from each span the skill is found within the posting and calculated
* Pay is extracted and calculated for multiple frequencies (annual, monthly, weekly, etc.)
* Job titles and skills are embedded using the latest OpenAI model (Large) and then clustered
* Skill count and pay percentile (what are the top skills for the job and which skills pay the most)
   * Ordered by highest to lowest in the table
* Apple is hiring a shit ton of AI/ML (translation: the singularity is *nearer*)

The full report is available at my website [hazon.fyi](https://hazon.fyi)

Some things I want to do next:

* NER: Education and certifications
   * Easy to do but boring
* Subcategories: Add subcats to large categories (i.e. Software Engineering > DevOps)
* Assistant API: Build a resume builder that leverages the OpenAI Assistant API
* Observable Framework: Build some decent visuals now that I have a website

Please let me know what you think, critique first.

Thanks!

Advice for a New Data Scientist Struggling with Criticism,"As a relatively new data scientist, I need some frank advice. 

I recently switched from a more traditional software engineer role to a more data focused role. I'd describe myself as an exceptional data engineer, and an average, but enthusiastically improving data scientist. To that end, I'm also in school working through a graduate program in data science (50% done). 

My issue is that the better I get (at least on paper), the more people seem to criticize my analysis. There's many analysts at my office, but very few legitimate data science positions and I've had more than one good friend tell me that my analysis was too hard to understand. This always hits hard because I work very hard to be fair, honest, and understandable.

I honestly don't know if I'm being needlessly complex (to show off), if I'm bad at explaining my analysis, or if I'm just talking in the wrong way to the wrong people. I will say that it absolutely could be an ego issue because I do often feel a strong need to differentiate myself from the growing BI community. 

Is this a common feeling/experience for new data scientists?  For those of you that are more experienced, when you are asked to analyze data for general consumption (for non engineers), do you dumb everything down and leave out the checks and validation that give you confidence in your answers? 

If you are curious, this is probably a [decently representative project that I did for school](https://default.qc0qma7a4qq1g.us-east-2.cs.amazonlightsail.com/results). This was peer reviewed, so I assumed very little knowledge in the domain or in data science.

Thoughts on The Book “Essential Math For Data Science”?,"Haven’t seen much discussion of it here. I am mentoring an aspiring DS. She hadn’t taken a math course in about 10 years. She read this book over the course of about a month, and after looking over it, I thought it was pretty good. It was a no fluff introduction to the algebra, calculus, linear algebra, statistics needed for basic DS. 

Now of course this book wouldn’t make you a researcher, but it seemed like enough to be dangerous on the job as a product or analytics focused DS, before diving into math more deeply.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/133bpns/thoughts_on_the_book_essential_math_for_data/
I've found myself in a very unique situation at work. Has anyone else been here?,"So, I work for a very large company in their finance department. I recently got a new role on the data analytics team, and to my surprise, it seems like no one knows anything about data science, analytical methods, or best practices. 

A bit about myself, for the past 2 years, I've been teaching myself data science in order to get ahead. In this time, I've become really fluent in python, SQL, VBA, and general concepts such as ETL, wrangling...etc. I've also been able to use a lot of what I've learned in my current role. I'm by no means an expert, but I've been able to make some good progress at work with what I've done so far.

Back to the new role. I had a couple of interviews with my new boss and director, and started describing the ETL process I do for email data. They had never heard of ETL. Beyond that, someone from their team reached out to me later and asked if I could help them find the name for a database in MS SQL. When I asked what type of data they were looking for they sent me a screenshot of the table with db name attached. It seemed as if they didn't understand the difference between a db, server, or table.

Struggling to mentor junior,"As a senior engineer, I'm leading a machine learning project for a client in commodity trading. Our current stage involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the client's data, create valuable features, and generate insights.

During the EDA, I'm focusing on regression analysis for feature importance. Meanwhile, I've assigned a junior engineer to cluster the data based on feature characteristics. However, mentoring him is challenging due to his reluctance to explore unfamiliar concepts. For instance, he's hesitant to include metrics like stock price elasticity of demand in his analysis, despite its significance to the client and my explanation of its importance.

His analytical inexperience seems overwhelming for him, leading to a dismissive attitude towards more complex concepts. How can I effectively guide him to be more open and proactive in his approach to the analysis?

EDIT: Thanks everyone for suggestions. I think I just needed to make it explicitly clear to him that it is okay for him to take time to learn the theory behind clustering and give him time to think.  I think this was causing the issue because we had a bullshit deadline by the end of the week (including his analysis) to get this done, but I successfully pushed it back so.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/1afm33o/struggling_to_mentor_junior/

Caching Jupyter Notebook Cells for Faster Reruns,"Hey r/datascience! We created a plugin to easily cache the results of functions in jupyter notebook cells. The intermediate results are stored in a pickle file in the same folder.

This helps solve a few common pains we've experienced:

\- **accidentally overwriting variables**: You can re-run a given cell and re-populate any variable (e.g. if you reassigned \`df\` to some other value)\_

\- **sharing notebooks for others to rerun / reproduce**: Many collaborators don't have access to all the same clients / tokens, or all the datasets. Using xetcache, notebook authors can cache any cells / functions that they know are painful for others to reproduce / recreate.

\- **speed up rerunning**: even in single player mode, being able to rerun through your entire notebooks in seconds instead of minutes or hours is really really fun

Efficient alternatives to a cumbersome VBA macro,"I'm not sure if I'm posting this in the most appropriate subreddit, but I got to thinking about a project at work.

My job role is somewhere between data analyst and software engineer for a big aerospace manufacturing company, but digital processes here are a bit antiquated. A manager proposed a project to me in which financial calculations and forecasts are done in an Excel sheet using a VBA macro - and when I say huge I mean this thing is 180mb of aggregated financial data. To produce forecasts for monthly data someone quite literally runs this macro and leaves their laptop on for 12 hours overnight to run it.

I say this company's processes are antiquated because we have no ML processes, Azure, AWS or any Python or R libraries - just a base 3.11 installation of Python is all I have available.

Resources for improving at probability problems in interviews?,"
I’m a data scientist with a bit of a weird background. I have PhD in my domain field and transitioned into data science after graduating by self-teaching missing ds skills (mostly coding and ML). My current ds job is in my domain and I spend most of my time coding for ML projects. 

I’ve noticed that when I try to read up on data science interviews, I’m disproportionately very weak in everything related to probability. It’s just something that I wasn’t really exposed to in grad school or my current position. For example, I struggle with most of the “easy” problems in the probability chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview. Where can I get started with learning to answer these types of interview questions? Is there a book or course that covers probability considering what’d be expected from a data scientist?

DataAnalyst.com - I launched a niche job board with hand curated data analyst jobs. Here's the summary of how it's going after the seventh month,"Hi all,

on Dec 19th I launched [DataAnalyst.com](https://dataanalyst.com) \- this is the seventh update of hopefully many more to come - it'll be a shorter one this time.

 Want to make sure I document the journey, and keep myself honest, so each month I will be making a post about the statistics, progress, some thoughts and what are the next steps I want to be focusing on. 

While the main purpose for the post is to bring everyone along on the journey, I do think that members of r/datascience might benefit from the site, especially those looking for a new data analyst job. I'd also love to engage with people on the sub who'd like to share their data analyst career journey.

So, just a reminder that early stages vision is to become the #1 job board for data analysts - hand-picking interesting data analyst job opportunities across industries.

Let's dive right in:

# 1. General Observations

## Stats

DataAnalyst.com has been online for just over 7 months and we've brought over 1,500 hand curated data analyst jobs onto the site - all of them including a salary range. 

There's almost 1,600 people subscribed to the newsletter, and I can't thank you enough for your support and for joining us on the journey.

Following the site traffic and visitors peak in April/May, there's been a noticeable drop on those metrics.

In the early days, I would be posting between 10 - 15 jobs daily, looking to brute-force the marketplace conundrum and bring initial traffic in. At the same time I knew this was not sustainable in the long run, particularly on the monetization front - if companies see jobs added by me for free, why would they engage themselves?

So for now, I'm attributing this dump in traffci to the decrease in number of job postings added daily to the site and potentially also the wide-spread summer slump - people taking time off, organizations are slowing down hiring (which I've also noticed when hand picking available roles) and overall, activity drops.

The decrease also goes hand in hand with decrease of social media posts on Twitter/Linked, leading to less social media traffic. I have however added new profile pages on Facebook and Instagram, similarly automating job postings there, so will see how those channels perform.

While looking at the numbers go down isn't a pretty sight, I do believe that in combination with the organic traffic, it makes sense to have the (hopefully) short term dip, as it'll pave way for monetizing. Obviously this means there will be less jobs to apply to for now, but until I see steady inflow of company-posted jobs, I will not be looking to decrease the frequency / quality / quanity of listings any more.

I've also spent some time last month using tools such as SEMRush / Ahrefs / Moz to run some high level audits and understand how the site performs on the SEO front. This led to a lot of time spent on making significant on-page changes to improve keyword optimisation, rewriting meta descriptions and adding alt descriptions to all the images on the site. This is probably something that could (and should) have been done a lot earlier, but oh well.

## BusinessAnalyst.com

Some of you may have noticed that I've also recently launched [BusinessAnalyst.com](https://bussinessanalyst.com) \- where I'm looking to replicate step by step what I've done over the last 6 months with DataAnalyst. The overall idea is to create a network of sites, benefiting from the same infastructure, serving and helping different career paths, and making a collaboration with organisations much more appealing (afterall, most companies who hire for data analysts also look for business analysts and vice versa). Arguably, this might not make much sense seeing that DA still hasn't brought any revenue in, but on the other hand, I can reuse the whole tech stack and structures already in place, halve my cost per project, while doubling the surface area to catch me some luck.

Seeing July has been the first full month of having the site up, I will be also documenting the journey and posting a progress update on appropriate subreddits.

# 2. Expanding the data analyst salary guide

We are continuing on our mission to building out DataAnalyst.com - not just as a job board, but also as an educational hub - from interviews with experienced professional, best practices, to advice about getting into the industry.

As mentioned in my previous updates, there's been guides recently released.

**How to become a data analyst guide** which covers topics such as:

* understanding the role and responsibilities of a data analyst
* becoming a data analyst, and what it obtains - from education, experience, to technical and soft skills
* the well known not-so-secret hack - building your own portfolio
* career development and salary guide (yes, our own!)

[**The data analyst salary guide**](https://www.dataanalyst.com/salary-guide) \- which provides the overview of salaries in various industries - and also shows a more detailed view on each industry page, with a deep dive into how much entry level, senior and lead data analysts can earn depending on their experience. 

Over the course of last month I've been restructuring some of the ways I collect and store data about available job roles, and I was able to expand the data analyst salary guide beyond just industry - now also detailing **data analyst salaries across different states in the US.**

Now, as it usually is with this kind of exercise, lumping the data all together you come up with an insane range. On the other hand, if you split the data in 52 different ways, you'll get a whole different set of issues where N is not large enough to draw any conclusions - and for some states, there's simply no data at all.

As the site grows, and the number of jobs on the site increases, I do however believe that I'll be able to bring an addition source of information about salaries, complimenting those already available on other sites.

For the US, we've also released the July edition of Market Insights, you can see the full report in the blog section on the site as well.

# What's currently on my mind (random musings)

**Re: Newsletter** \- when starting, I wanted the newsletter to be sent on a weekly basis, containing the latest jobs. The more I thought about it, the more I became against the idea - afterall, people could visit the site and see, why spam their emails? At the same time, the point of the site is to help people find a role - once they would, they wouldn't really need weekly emails with latest jobs.

I was recently able to implement better tracking of job views - how many people have viewed which job post. It may be that I could use this data to send a weekly ""hottest data analyst jobs on the plafrom for the last week"" - however, to do so, I believe I need to include segmentation into my email list i.e people looking for a job will receive these, whilst others would be able to opt out. This will require some restructuring of the current newsletter onboarding flow, but that's probably better to be done sooner, rather than later.

**Re: Improving site experience** \- I go through every single comment I receive on Reddit, and there's been a few in the last month or two, highlighting some inconsistencies in terms of UX/UI experience across mobile/table/desktop versions. I've spent some time over the last few weeks to address some of those bugs, discovered a whole bunch more, and have been fixing them one by one. I do want the site to be easy to use, with consistent styling and experience - so, if you come across bugs, please just let me know :)

# Things in the pipeline

* New data analyst jobs, added daily
* Actually launching the weekly newsletter with the pick of best jobs directly to your inbox (yes, I know...., but...above...)
* Monthly US data analyst market insights
* Improving the overall site experience (this one is a never ending activity)
* Continuing to bring you Data Analysts across their experience levels, to share tips, tricks and their thoughts

Is a Convex Optimization class good for Data Science?," For context, I am a Master's student in CS and lurking in sub has made me realize that CS guys need more statistical background regarding DS positions. Hence, the motivation. However, I am already taking a course called Foundations course which feels like a quick Statistics walkthrough. I am also taking an Automated Learning course which basically follows the ISL contents. This course would be the third one? or the fourth one if I plan to audit this one.

This is what the course page says : 

Student Learning Outcomes: 

Master the essential tools of convex analysis, ability to characterize solutions to convex optimization problems, ability to formulate standard data science problems as convex optimization problems, and understanding the structure and implementation of the main classes of algorithms for solving optimization problems in data science.

Detailed Content: 

Iteration principles, fixed-point algorithms, convex sets and convex cones, best approximation paradigms, projection methods in convex feasibility problems – applications to data fusion and image recovery, convex functions, conjugation of convex functions, duality in convex optimization, subdifferential calculus, subgradient algorithms for convex feasibility and best approximation – applications in inverse problems, proximity operators, proximal calculus, forward-backward splitting and variants (Dykstra-like methods, Chambolle-Pock algorithm, dual ascent method, etc.), Douglas-Rachford splitting and variants (parallel proximal algorithm, alternating direction method of multipliers, composite primal-dual method, etc.), the monotone + skew decomposition principle – primal-dual algorithms, proximal modeling of statistical information, proximal information extraction, proximal sparsity enforcement, proximal data classification, proximal principal component analysis, proximal image reconstruction, proximal learning, proximal methods for matrix-based learning, scalability: proximal methods in big data problems, special topics.

Data Science technical skills fading after 2 years post graduation,"Hello I’m 24M working for a big company as a Data Analyst in HR. I graduated in 2021 with a master’s degree in Data Science and I had a good grasp of concepts related to Data Science and hands-on experience with school projects but I didn’t have the opportunity to use my data science technical skills for the past 2 years or very rarely ( e.g not a single opportunity of using SQL or R, I used Python for very specific requests that required 15-20 lines of code ). I’ve been using Alteryx as ETL extensively and I’ve now sharp skills in using Alteryx for Data prep, cleaning and so on. The point is that I feel like my skills in Python, SQL, Machine Learning are fading more and more as I keep using the same tools which are not useful when applying to other jobs ( I’m currently looking for another job ) and I know that based on my current level in Python for example, it’s simply not enough even for a junior Data Analyst position.

How to prepare myself for next role as NLP Engineer/DS?,"My current position is Senior Data Scientist, it is my second role, before that I was a DS consultant and I have about 4-5 yoe, depends on you count it. 

I have been working at my current place for about 2 years, and I got to the point where my learning is bounded. I am very appreciated at my current workplace, and I had the luck of entering to the company at a good time, so I took part in the development of several central pipelines, and saw our product become profitable. For the past six months, however, I have been feeling stuck and frustrated. Due to bad management we are now micro-managed by our CEO. It doesn't look like I have a lot of place to grow, and my direct manager isn't at a point he can guild me on ML and has a very modest technical stack to be generous. 

For the past year, I started to develop interest in NLP, and since then I did on my spare time a lot of learning and some side project in varying complexity. In my work as well, I was able to push for using some of the things that I learned (also by doing extra hours, but it was for me as well). So far I led a project were we trained a RoBERTa model from scratch, including tokenization as we deal with somewhat a different domain than the off-the-shelf pre-trained datasets are familiar with. I also trained more modest models including siamese network to learn similarity between strings of different sources, and a Word2Vec for word embeddings when the use case made more sense than using contextual embeddings. All of the above are projects that ended up being delivered to customers, which I led from a-z.

I know that in four months or so, I would like to start looking for a new place, and I know that I am looking for a place where I could deepen my knowledge about working with textual data. In the meantime I am trying to read as many papers as my time allows (both inside and outside of work), and I try to look for problems I can solve with NLP in my current workplace. Our main product is based on classification and we are heavily focus on low latency, so with these two limitations, I am struggling to see how transformer decoders (LLMs) can help. 

I don't know if the above would suffice to land a first job as an NLP engineer/DS in a company that focuses on textual data. **I am wondering what can I do in order to set myself apart from other candidates, and what hiring managers in such companies look for in a prospective candidate**.

Do models still matter?,There’s a lot more focus on implementation than back a few years ago when there was  POC after POC but far fewer models made it to production. There was also the beginnings of more focus on explainable ML and more focus on scrutinising models for bias of different types. However as MLOps has really taken off the focus on productionising seems to have lead to less focus on the models themselves.

Let's team up and create an app to detect fermentation issues in style! 🥬🧪,"Hi all

I spend a lot of time on /r/fermentation and I've noticed that many posts there are along the lines of ""I made this thing, is it infected?"" Most of the time, it's perfectly fine. The real dangerous stuff, like mold, is usually easy to spot. This got me thinking about creating an app that allows users to upload photos and get help in identifying obvious issues. 

my tensorflow fu is weak but my data engineer skills are strong. anyone interested in partnering up in putting this together?  what i need from you:

\- Assistance with the TensorFlow (or alternative) model. My preference is to use Python for the web layer.

\- Help in collecting input and validation data. I have come across a few smaller datasets, but I'm not sure if they are extensive enough for training and validating the model.

&#x200B;

Here's what I'll bring to the project:

\- I'll take the TensorFlow model and build a Streamlit app on top of it.

\- The app layer will have a FastAPI backend endpoint.

\- I'll cover all infrastructural or hosting costs.

\- The app will be hosted on Kubernetes (K8s) and available over SSL through Nginx.

\- Any changes committed to GitHub will be deployed through ArgoCD.

&#x200B;

Please note that this is a hobby project and it will never be a paid service. I'm not doing this to enhance my resume; I simply think it's a cool idea that can be (relatively) easily achieved.

&#x200B;

Here are the common contaminants I'd like to identify. The really harmful ones have bright colors that contrast nicely:

&#x200B;

\- Mold: Any mold growth should be considered potentially harmful.

   1. Penicillium: This mold can appear as blue or green patches on the surface of sauerkraut.

   2. Cladosporium: This mold typically appears as black or brown spots.

   3. Aspergillus: This mold can appear in various colors such as green, black, or gray.

   4. Mucor: This mold may show as white or gray fuzzy patches on the surface.

&#x200B;

\- Yeast: Yeast is not typically considered harmful, but it can lead to off flavors.

   1. Kahm yeast is a type of wild yeast . not dangerous but off tasting. It appears as a white or cream-colored film on the surface and can sometimes develop in areas where the brine is exposed to air.

Pulling Data from SQL into Python,"Hi all,

I'm coming into a more standard data science role which will primarily use python and SQL. In your experience, what are your go to applications for SQL (oracleSQL) and how do you get that data into python?

This may seem like a silly question to ask as a DA/DS professional already, but professionally I have been working in a lesser used application known as alteryx desktop designer. It's a tools based approach to DA that allows you to use the SQL tool to write queries and read that data straight into the workflow you are working on. From there I would do my data preprocessing in alteryx and export it out into a CSV for python where I do my modeling. I am already proficient in stats/DS and my SQL is up to snuff, I just don’t know what other people use  and their pipeline from SQL to python since our entire org basically only uses Alteryx.

Thanks!

Using synthetic data to reduce a form of hallucination in LLMs,"**Credit: I read about this in** [**this AI newsletter**](https://tomorrownow.beehiiv.com/p/new-ai-social-media-app-befake-llms-will-agree-false-claims-four-camps-ai-doom-scenarios) **and the research paper was written by Google Deepmind.**

**Summary**:

*Researchers investigated ""sycophancy"" in LLMs - the tendency to agree with a user's opinion, even if it's wrong. Models even agreed with blatantly false math claims if the user signaled agreement. Analyzing three sycophancy tasks showed model size and instruction tuning increased this behavior. A simple synthetic data intervention was proposed, fine-tuning models to strengthen resistance to freely available opinions. This reduced sycophantic behavior, especially on new prompts.*

&#x200B;

**Why does it matter?**

* Bigger isn't always better: Larger LLMs displayed more sycophantic behavior, suggesting scale alone won't solve this issue. Instruction tuning also increased sycophancy.
* Social grounding requires care: Humans operate within shared social frames of reference. Simulating social dynamics for AI comes with risks if models lack proper grounding in facts/logic.
* More work to be done: Simple solutions like synthetic data fine-tuning are promising starting points, but comprehensively addressing problematic behaviors like sycophancy will require more sophisticated solutions.

Data Engineering as fallback once the LLM hype dies down?,"I am facing quite a lot of anxiety about the DS field right now. I am a data scientist on paper, but for the past few years doing “full-stack” ML developments. This means from building feature stores, predictive models, inference endpoints and retraining pipelines. 

Over the recent months I saw so many organizations expanding their DS teams with the intention of integrate AI into their products, seemingly solely out of hype from the business execs or investors. Many of these AI features don’t seem to generate enough business value compared to the cost of building them. I’m sure at one point the businesses will notice this too. Obviously I know not all of DS is ML, but a huge portion of the job demands out there have that expectation.

At the same time, this field is getting so damn saturated. 3 out of 5 people I met last week are persuing/has attained a masters in DS/ML. (Tbf it was a non-academic event at a university) I don’t think I want to be here in a few years when we get 23 masters degree holders competing for one junior DS position.

All these could be just my anxiety speaking, so please correct me if I’m mistaken about the current situation. However, my guts is telling me to make the jump to data engineering, which is the closest thing to what currently do, but my degree was in Stats and not CS. 

What is the best way to make this transition? Is there a middle ground between DS and DE which I can explore? Any book or article recommendations will greatly appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/15pb4rq/data_engineering_as_fallback_once_the_llm_hype/
Data Analyst Bootcamp,"Hello beautiful Reddit community 

I would like to put you in a bit of context about my case and see if you can help me, I would be eternally grateful. 

Well, I'm a 28 year old chemical engineer, currently not working in the field I study (My programming skills are not the best, but I practice almost every day).

I have been working as a credit analyst for almost 3 years, but I got desperate to grow since you have to be friends with the senior manager. 

 So I have decided to create a path in the data world and become a data analyst as soon as I had the knowledge requested. 

This is something I was itching with curiosity since 1 year approx. So since then I have been self taught with Python, but of course I know this is not enough.

So I have asked for information about some bootcamps in my country, but in my opinion, these are quite expensive and not recognized enough that another bootcamp in another country might have. 

Yesterday I saw a post where a guy was asking for help for a good example of bootcamp, and someone answered that Great Learning with MIT bootcamps collaboration is a very good option. So I had my interview a few minutes ago and the prices are not that expensive and it's close to my budget. 

 So I am here entirely asking for your help and advice you could give me and if you recommend me which bootcamp or if you have another option it will be well appreciated. 

Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/15acrw9/data_analyst_bootcamp/
What other jobs would see experience as a Data Scientist as valuable/desirable?,"I have a little more than 4 years of experience as a data scientist but only a BS in Math for education. I have been almost completely unable to get interviews since leaving my last job way back in August (Hundreds of applications and dozens of calls from recruiters and only *two* technical interviews). 

If I wanted to apply to other jobs to try to broaden my search what kind of jobs would see a candidate with a standard data scientist skillset as an appealing candidate?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/14v3y0v/what_other_jobs_would_see_experience_as_a_data/
Leveraging causality in data science? How are you guys employing causal inference?,"Every few months I like to deep dive on an area of statistical methodology. Recently I had done this with Bayesian statistics, through the book Bayesian data analysis by Andrew Gelman. 

Now that this chapter is complete, I look to a newer area, into the branch of statistics known as causal inference. Everyone has their own interpretation of causality. What framework is more useful for them. Rubin vs Pearl, etc. 

I find these debates to not be conducive to the real goal, and so I don’t want anything like this in this discussion post.

I would like however, to hear some instances where you guys are leveraging causal inference  
In your day to day, and more importantly the areas of business where causality and causal inference could be a potential goal for businesses to gain more insights. 

Some ideas that come to mind is in experimentation. Can we leverage these causal inference methodologies to improve in marketing analytics? How can causality be interpreted with A/B testing? 

I’d like to know, whether it be using rubins potential outcomes framework, or pearls DAGs. 

How are you all leveraging causality and causal inference in data science?",https://www.reddit.com//r/datascience/comments/14sjss2/leveraging_causality_in_data_science_how_are_you/
